        "abstract": "This paper describes in detail a system and its architecture for managing direction change and braking signals on scooters and bicycles, using a sensor with an accelerometer and gyroscope on the back of the hand. The project aims to provide a solution for direction signals on the crank without removing the hand from the handlebars, thus avoiding the resulting accidents. The user is able to indicate a change of direction by gestures such as turning the hand sideways, so that it is not necessary to take the hand completely off the steering wheel, thus maintaining the balance of the vehicle. Brake signals are automatic as a result of acceleration sensing. The system uses two microcontrollers (ESP32 and ESP8266), one of which processes the sensor data, while the other runs a web server and lights the corresponding LEDs. The web server is responsible for the communication between the microcontrollers and also runs a web page that acts as a user interface. On the web page, active signals such as turn signals and brake signals are displayed and can be switched on and off. Communication between the different components is wireless using WiFi technology.",

        "abstract": "This thesis presents the implementation of a smart home control system. The system mainly performs home automation tasks such as temperature control, watering of plants and automatic movement of shutter, thus facilitating the user's daily life. Nowadays, IoT devices are playing an increasingly important role for people, and we can't imagine our lives without them. Since most people have an internet connection at home, building such an IoT system is easier, cheaper and more efficient because there is no need for wires to communicate between devices. The system I developed and built consists of a central computer with a touch screen display connected to it, where you can follow and intervene in the automation processes, you can see statistics about the temperature in the room, for example. Several sensors are connected to this central part via Bluetooth or MQTT communication protocols, which provide data and perform the automation tasks. In my thesis I document the design and construction of this system in detail, illustrating each part with diagrams.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the thesis is to create a system that can be integrated between a computer and the attached network. The system should be capable of monitoring and processing packets passing between the computer and the network, and modifying specified packets. One of the data packets to be modified is the NTP packet, with the goal of having the computer synchronize its internal clock according to the modified packets from the integrated system, rather than the time received from the actual servers. The second type of packet to be modified is the DNS packet, with the goal of having the computer receive a falsified response modified by the integrated system for certain domain names, containing an internally selected IPv4 address instead of the server's response. Another important task of the system is monitoring the passing traffic. The primarily observed packets are TLS, FTP, and HTTP packets, with the aim of extracting and transparently displaying relevant content. Since FTP and HTTP packets are not encrypted, information such as passwords and usernames can also be extracted. To achieve these goals, a Raspberry Pi is integrated between the computer and the network, implementing the aforementioned tasks in Python. This program uses the Scapy library to monitor network traffic, modify network packets, and display their content. It forwards packets arriving at one attached network interface to another attached network interface while processing them and saving the relevant fields.",

        "abstract": "The web application built for the exam has been named „The Ride” and the purpose behind is to create a well designed and responsive platform for people who want to travel, commute and explore. The inspiration behind the idea was the fact that there are a number of Facebook groups meant to simplify the search for ride sharing, however, there are not that many individual applications built for this purpose. This was the source of inspiration behind my web application. An important factor for the project was that it must provide an added value compared to similar solutions, for example Blablacar that is currently available in our country. Facebook groups are more widespread compared to other ride sharing applications due to the personal aspect of the social media platform. Blablacar is an international company whose application is used in multiple countries, which is the reason why building a community is more difficult there. „The Ride”, on the other hand, is only available for regions in Romania and Hungary, which meant to build a stronger, more familiar connection with the local users. My goal for the application was to be able to create the entire route when adding a new ride, as well as to provide a breakdown of locations that the ride is passing through. It’s crucial that the users are provided with good recommendations for rides. This functionality is built with the help of Google Maps APIs which will be discussed further in the exam paper.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays medical image processing is a dynamically evolving science and industry. The rapid development of computers makes it possible to implement increasingly complex procedures. However, it is also possible for the computer to trigger the more tedious part of a human expert’s work and enable the doctor to focus only on cases where the computer has found something abnormal or suspicious. With this thesis, I also want to follow this trend. I propose to implement a machine learning procedure that can efficiently and accurately segment brain tissues based on MRI scans of six-month-old infants. During the implementation, I worked with the data published at the iSeg-2017 competition. From the OpenCV machine learning library, I found the discrete AdaBoost classifier to be the most suitable for segmentation, and I added a post-processing to improve the results of the classifier. In addition, I implemented software with a graphical user interface that can be used to launch segmentation tasks, visualize the results, and manage the inventory of performed operations. The average accuracy of the implemented segmentation procedure was slightly above 85%.",

In the first half of the paper, I will describe neural networks based on the literature, starting from simple M-P neurons to convolutional neural networks, covering their structure and their training. In the second half of the paper, I present three models I developed that classified brain tumours into four groups with an accuracy of over 85%. The first model I implemented was a simple convolutional neural network. With the second model I achieved only moderate performance improvements by changing the architecture and preventing overfitting. For both models I tuned the hyperparameters. The best performing model was the third one, implemented with transfer learning and using VGG16 as the base model. This model achieved the best accuracy (96%). In developing the three models, I used methods to continuously improve the performance of neural networks by understanding the different mechanisms of action. The model I developed could form the basis for an application that provides practicing radiologists with rapid preclassification in seconds, making their job easier.",

        "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have gained great popularity for their accuracy in image processing, data mining, classification tasks, and decision-making systems in which previously only humans were able to make the right decisions. However, neural networks cannot yet completely replace humans, because humans design them depending on the given task. Hardware accelerators are used to increase the performance of neural networks. There have been plenty of studies on hardware accelerators in recent years. One of the options are FPGA circuits. The main advantages of FPGAs used for hardware acceleration are parallelism, low power consumption and flexibility. Implementing neural networks on FPGA is a very time consuming and difficult task, that can only be performed by experienced professionals. The framework we have developed provides solution to this problem. The purpose of the framework is to accelerate and facilitate the implementation of neural networks \"running\" on an FPGA, to accelerate neural networks, to study optimization options in terms of size and performance, and to automate the programming process. The parameterizable neural network models, implemented by the high-level synthesis discussed in the dissertation, serve as the basis of the framework, that generates the code of the neural networks modelled in C ++ optimized by directives. The Vivado HLS tool generates the IP core of the neural network from this code. It automatically integrates into a system built in Vivado. The Vivado tool generates the bit file needed to program the FPGA and programs the circuit. The paper includes the implementation of a multilayer perceptron neural network and a radial basis function network, hardware implementations of nonlinear activation functions, comparison of fixed-point and floating-point number representations.",

Backgammon and image processing cover two areas of particular interest to me.. The Romanian Backgammon Federation organizes various national and international competitions, where tracking and automatic arbitration are of particular interest. The Python programming language allows for the creation of virtual versions of backgammon, which gives the game a new dimension by interactively playing it on the computer. The goal of game programming was to enable two players to compete against each other on the computer and record the game for later replay. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular library used in image processing. With its help, the computer can recognize shapes and process images, allowing for capturing the sequential playing positions. My goal in the field of image processing, was to extract still frames from a video and identify the position of pieces, thus tracking the game's progress. Therefore, my objective was to create an application by combining Python and OpenCV that automatically evaluates the board game. The software to be made must recognize the positions of pieces and tracks the players' moves, allowing for virtual gameplay between two individuals.",

A few examples out of these sciences are social sciences, medicine or even agricultural sciences. Nowadays our smartphones spend more time in our hands than in our pockets. New ideas, new solutions, and new innovations are constantly born to combine agricultural sciences and computer technology. In this diploma work I wanted to incorporate different CNN based object detection algorithms into an Android application that recognizes different cultivated plant seeds through the camera of the smartphone, in real time. In addition to object detection, it performs calculations of the seeds area, mass, and size with a reference value. The 21 types of plant seeds which were trained include, for example, three types of peas, two types of corn, sunflower, wheat, barley, rye, faba bean etc. With a training dataset containing almost 50,000 samples created by me with some help, YOLOs and MobileNets were able to achieve an accuracy of almost 80%. Due to compatibility errors, I only managed to integrate the YOLO algorithms into the application. The stated goal of this thesis was an easy-to-use, accurate plant seed recognition application that works even at the fields. Finally, I managed to create an application that works in laboratory conditions, which with possible further development could also be suitable for use at the fields with possible further development.",

The goal of my thesis was to build a scalable system for sensors, created with the help of an Arduino, which helps in the integration of new sensors in the system for users, who may face a challenge when integrating a new sensor in an environment with Arduino and microcontrollers. At the beginning I had to create a text-based protocol, written with ASCII code, which provides for the user an interface for dynamic configuration of the sensors and for the collective data forwarding. Several different sensors have been integrated into the sensor system, with which it is possible to measure different physical quantities and monitor changes in values, but also an interface for the collected data. For the better understanding of the real-time data collected by the sensors with the help of the Arduino I have also created a desktop application,, through which the real-time data measured by the sensors connected to the Arduino can be displayed, and it is also possible to save and review the data. The communication between the application and the sensors is realized by serial communication. I designed the application to be used for laboratory purposes.",

Routing protocols play a key role in the selection and routing of data packets to reach their destination through the network. Routing protocols are based on different algorithms, which have different characteristics and operating principles. The aim of this documentation is to create a model to visualise the application of routing protocols, the propagation of packets and the evaluation of data. It also provides a means to compare the performance and efficiency of different routing protocols. Routing protocols are critical to the operation of wireless networks. A thorough understanding of the algorithms and their implementations will allow for a better understanding of the operation of networks, the detection of potential failures, and efficient planning, optimisation and operation. The documentation helps to understand the operation, advantages and limitations of different routing protocols, and helps to simulate networks by providing detailed code for simulations written in the OMNeT++ framework. Three routing protocols are described, a data-centric one (Gossiping), a hierarchical one (LEACH) and a location-based one (GAF), their comparison, conclusions drawn and the performance and efficiency of the routing protocols under study.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, geopositioning can be done on even the smallest devices, such as a smart watch or a smart phone. Each of the GPS applications uses the reverse geocoding feature of the map application to give the user accurate information about their location. To be able to do this, the map application must be backed by a serious database that stores geographic data for millions of points around the world. There are many applications that can provide very accurate map data to users. The most known applications are Google Maps, Bing Maps, Apple Maps, and the open source OpenStreetMap. One of the great advantages of OpenStreetMap is that it is open source, but it is also one of it’s weaknesses, because being open source, anyone can update the data in its database. OpenStreetMap allows for local installation through software called Nominatim, this means that companies can become independent from big companies who provide Map APIs for huge amount of money. Installing such a server requires a huge amount of disk space, and the amount of data continues to grow after installation due to updates. The aim of this dissertation is to develop a software system that allows the Nominatim web server data to be updated automatically, but also allows the user to manage the update process. The software system consists of two main components, a web application that tests the data. A server collection that allows you to update the data in the database. The web application is an ASP. NET Core application implemented with an MVC architectural pattern. This testing application allows the user to test the differences between two Nominatim servers. The server collection consists of three ubuntu servers with Nominatim software installed. Their job is to update the data in the database.",

        "abstract": "A significant proportion of biological phenomena can be traced back to genetics, which is based on gene sequences. Decoding these gene sequences represents a substantial challenge in the field of biological sciences. According to a bold estimate, this task could potentially engage the scientific community for the next five hundred years. The aim of my thesis is to implement a simple gene sequence classification algorithm and integrate this algorithm into a software, equipped with a graphical user interface. This may represent a small step toward the solution of decoding gene sequences. This implemented algorithm performs classification based on similarity data from gene sequence pairs within a larger sequence dataset. This methodology allows us to simultaneously process large amount of protein sequences and grouping these sequences based on their similarity. This is made possible by working with sparse matrices which eliminates unnecessary operations, such as addition and multiplication with zero. At the same time, this method has significant memory efficiency, because we only store the none zero values. This method treats the input sequence dataset as a graph. Each protein is assigned a node within the graph, and the initial edges between the nodes are received as input data from the SCOP95 database. These values were created using the BLAST algorithm and they’re form a sparse matrix. This algorithm is a modified form of Markov clustering, in which the two main operations, inflation and expansion, work against each other. Connected subgraphs remaining in the equilibrium state, defining the final result of the clustering. The main parameter of the algorithm is the inflation rate, which determines how much the algorithm separates groups from each other. The graphical user interface provides the opportunity to perform the classification on the 11,944-element SCOP95 dataset or on its subparts, using various settings and can display these resulting protein groups. Furthermore, from any group, we can select two sequences and observe the results of their alignment, which is implemented using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The algorithm could process up to one million protein sequences in a few hours, but unfortunately an appropriate real dataset was not available for this purpose.",

In my thesis, I will compare several food ordering apps, their usage, and I will also present an application developed by me, that has been in real use for more than three months in the villages near Odorheiu Secuiesc, Cristuru Secuiesc and Gheorgheni. I used several technologies to create the application. The restaurant's internal system was written in Node.js/Express.js. The API that serves the mobile app was written in Node.js and finally for the mobile application I used React Native. In my thesis I will present in detail how the application works and how to use it. It is important to mention that I wanted to create a user interface by using the knowledge I gained at the university, which provides a ready-to-use system for the users, that is rather simple and easy to use. Another interesting aspect is that I made the application available in small villages where online food ordering was not yet available.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is the design and implementation of a system that makes the management of events of university open days easier and more transparent for both the organizers and participants. University open days are an annual event aimed at promoting the university among high school students and providing insight into its operation for those interested. This is an extremely important process because an outsider can really only get a deeper look into university life here before deciding to apply. There are several tasks involved in organizing an event, such as managing information related to the event and participants, which are slow and cumbersome to solve with traditional methods, hence the need for a system that makes the whole process more effortless and faster. The aim of my thesis is to create a system that offers solutions to the aforementioned problems, using the advantages of two modern frameworks. My system makes it more accessible to transfer information related to events, save participant related data, and create statistics from the existing dataset for the organizers. The system consists of three parts. I implemented the mobile application using the Flutter framework, which must be installed on users' phones and is platform-independent. Here, depending on their role, users can register, create new events, modify existing events, sign up for events, and generate statistics. In the background, a Spring Boot application runs, which provides access to the data stored in the database and processes and saves the data generated by the mobile application. The third part is the cloud-based storage provided by Firebase, where I store the images, and the MySQL relational database, where I store all other data.",

        "abstract": "Romania receives a large amount of money from the European Union to support farmers involved in agri-environmental and agricultural production. The brainchild of the project is the Milvus Association, which is involved in nature conservation research. They have observed that farmers have a big problem in obtaining information on subsidies, as there is currently no single website or application in Romania that collects subsidies and related information. To solve this problem, the APIA APP project was created, which consists of an Android application and a content management system. The aim of the application is to help local farmers to browse the subsidies available in Romania and to comply with the conditions attached to the subsidies. It also helps to follow the conditions of the subsidies already won. It helps farmers to win a grant by collecting the documents needed to win each grant. The development was done in Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, which supports multiplatform application development, the Android part was written in Kotlin. The thesis describes the client and server application, the technologies used for its implementation, covering the architecture and the functionalities. Two persons participated in the development of the application, namely Endre Györfi and István-Lehel Balázs. The development has been divided according to functionalities, which can be followed in detail in the use-case diagram presented in the thesis.",

In this paper, I present the steps of design, construction, and testing. Nowadays, computer technology is developing extremely fast, with redesigning and optimizing various elements. The processor is one of the most important components of a computer that executes instructions and controls the entire system. There are several types of processor architectures, such as Harvard and Neumann architectures. I built the processor presented in my dissertation on the principles of Harvard architecture. However, I also used a two-phase piping to make better use of the processor. This allows you to perform operations much faster. During the design of the processor, I also took into account the RISC design strategy, the essence of which is that the processor has a small number and simple instructions. This makes planning easier and faster. The aim of the dissertation is to compare the two processors, PicoBlaze and the processor I designed and developed, in terms of computational performance and process control performance. The tests performed can be divided into two groups, arithmetic tests and analog signal sampling tests. During arithmetic tests, I examined factorization and Fibonacci number sequence generation for both processors. During analog signal sampling, processors had to reproduce sine and square signals of different frequencies.",

Hardware accelerators are used for increasing the performance and efficiency of neural networks. An option for implementing such an accelerator is an FPGAbased system, although developing neural networks for FPGAs is very time-consuming and requires professionals to do it. In this article, we try to tackle this problem by creating a framework that should speed up the process. At the same time, we will take a look at some efficiency optimization and speed-up options as well. The framework is written in Python and generates a C++ code whit HLS directives. This code can be compiled by Vivado HLS into a hardware descriptive language and packaged as an IP. The Vivado tool can generate a bit file that can be uploaded onto the FPGA device. Among other things, the dissertation presents a comparison of different approximations of nonlinear transformations (base functions and activation functions) in terms of accuracy, required resource, and delay needed for evaluating the transformation. The generated neural network module was integrated into a system, that we developed. Using that system, we tested the neural network module and compared it with the models implemented in Python.",

Attendance management is a frequently recurring activity in order to allow instructors to keep track of students' attendance in class. Most teachers use traditional methods to record attendance. The main drawback of these methods is that they are time-consuming processes. By using digital tools, the time spent on this activity can be minimized and attendance recording is more transparent for both teachers and students. The aim of this thesis was to design and build an application that would facilitate and speed up the process of attendance management by taking advantage of the benefits of technology. To produce the software, I tested and used a new software development methodology called Progressive Web Application. I created a platform-independent application that uses the Web NFC API technology to manage presences quickly and reliably, and I also created an Androidbased native application that uses Bluetooth technology in case the user's mobile device is not capable of using NFC technology. The result was a multi-platform progressive web application and a native application. Both software, taking into account the epidemiological situation, provide a contactless presence tracking and speed up and facilitate the management and tracking of the presence.",

Among the new possibilities and technological challenges, I aim to find solutions that can help us recognize and treat common cardiovascular diseases more effectively, thereby preventing premature or avoidable deaths. The main goal of my research is to develop new and advanced diagnostic systems specifically focused on the characteristics of cardiovascular diseases. These systems would enable more accurate and efficient diagnoses during the identification and treatment of these diseases. The foundation of my approach is the utilization of electrocardiography (ECG) signals in medicine. These signals provide precise and detailed information about the heart's electrical activity, making it possible to detect various heart diseases or other abnormalities. The first step involves preprocessing the signals, applying filtering and other normalization techniques. Then, I create an RGB color-channel image, a spectrogram. The spectrogram is a visual representation that shows the frequency spectrum of the signal over time. Different shades of color in the channels indicate the intensity of the frequencies, making it easier to analyze the structure and changes of the signal. This process helps extract essential information from the signals and reduces distortions caused by noise. These images serve as the input dataset for my deep learning-based training software, whose main task is to recognize four specific diseases. Therefore, my system will be able to identify patterns or subtle details that are not visible to the human eye, providing more accurate diagnoses for people. This can significantly contribute to improving healthcare outcomes and enhancing the quality of life.",

The user is given the opportunity to visualise different recursive functions using the software. Unlike the usual visualization tools, this application uses the method of stairs to visualize the depth of recursion. The presented software can be useful not only for students who want to learn, but also for all those who want to explore the phenomenon of recursion by observing interesting patterns in visualizations. 7",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, most people have smartphones that allow them to solve various problems using different applications. StayConnected is an innovative application that not only helps maintain users’ social connections but also offers numerous useful features to facilitate travel and daily tasks. The current features of the application include posting pictures, exchanging messages with other users, and creating personal profiles where users can view their posts, items for sale, and events they have created. One of the main functions of the application is navigation, which works using Flutter Map. Users can create routes or trips consisting of multiple points and specify several points within a selected radius, which draws points of interest (POIs). By selecting these, the route connects these points. Holding down on a point on the map allows users to create events, such as a car meet-up. Additional features of the application include the visibility of users on the map, along with their last login location and time. The market function allows users to post items for sale, and the posting location is added to the item, which, when clicked on by another user, the app automatically plans a route from the current location to the item’s location. The application has a search function that returns results for the entered text, including market and regular posts. The app receives and notifies the user of notifications, such as when they receive a message. The server behind the map is private. We run the OSRM API on our own server, and we direct our routing requests to this server. If the private server is unavailable, the app sends requests to the standard OSRM server, maximizing reliability. The application also includes a Q&A page where users can ask questions and others can respond. The application settings include a general settings page where users can set the app’s theme (four themes are available) and select the start page (feed page, navigation page, market page, or profile page). On the profile settings page, users can change their bio, username, and profile picture. The following features are under development: a library section where users can create categories and subcategories and upload documentation they own, a virtual garage that contains users’ cars, which will later be used for speed recommendations in route planning. Special events can be created while driving, such as reporting accidents or potholes based on the existing event creation function, and we also plan to expand the Q&A page by adding the ability to rate answers and evaluate the reliability of responders.",

        "abstract": "In today’s world, microcontroller systems can be found in a lot of things, and they have a big processing capacity and can be used in many different applications. They have a lot of functions, from making an LED blink to automating complex systems. They can also be easily connected to external components, allowing for even more diverse use cases. For this reason, the main goal of this dissertation is to create a system that can identify simple electronic components with their approximate values and pinouts. In electronics, there are many components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. When building a circuit, it is important to know what the component is and, more critically, what its pinout is—especially for semiconductors. Often, the identifier values are unreadable or there is no datasheet available, making component identification difficult. For this purpose, the electronic component tester was developed, which automatically identifies and displays the component values or indicates failure if it cannot identify the component. The process is fully automatic—only the component needs to be connected to the tester socket and toggle switch, or it automatically starts when connected to power. The dissertation covers microcontroller applications and their design for component recognition and measurement.",

This software will help the operator of an automated crane to avoid cases where, due to humanerror,the suppliersends the wrong type of PAL plate, or where, due to the same error, the woodworking company has ordered the wrong type of PAL plate. These mistakes can lead to PAL boards, because of a different type than the one set for the automated crane, being sent to the wrong place in the warehouse or even the wrong type of board being processed. The wood processing plant provided data with images of the PAL plates, and from this, two classification algorithmswere implemented. Since onlyoneimagesampleof each PALplate exists in the database, traditional classifiers based on artificial intelligence cannot be used. For this reason, thetwoalgorithms thathave beenimplementedextract featuresfrom eachimageand use these features to compare the input sample with the images in the database for comparison. One of these methods, which has been implemented, determines the dominant colors of the images by clustering. By comparing dominantcolors,the algorithmis able todeterminehow similar two images are to each other. By calculating the Euclidean distance between the dominant colors, it can give a value for how different the two images are from each other, obviously the smaller the distance, the more similar the images are. Another method that has been implemented is to split the imagesintosegments andthen compute a histogram for each segment. These histograms are then concatenated to create a feature vector for the images. It then compares the feature vectors using chi-square distance. The conclusions are that the algorithms are sensitive to rotation. However, nice results will be obtained ifa segmentof theimagesis created, oronlyone dominantcolorisselected and compared.",

Although Desktop applications have an important role in the lives of users and IT workers. With the quick evolution of mobile phones practically everything is possible using the smartphone in our pocket, but it couldn’t and probably will not be able to surpass computers for a while. The dissertation focuses on a system designed for personal computers or laptops that perfectly meets the role of a virtual assistant in our life. The IPA (intelligent personal assistant) softwares help the uses perform easy, but frequent tasks like browsing the internet, sending emails and swiftly opening applications while the input is not codes or signals, but simply a human voice. Presumably this is the reason for the success of this science that has grown into an industry. Virtual assistants are the blessing of the 21st century, but their history dates back to 1920. Every assistant is different, but their purpose is the same: serving the user. In our case a user is person in front of a computer whose job Sapientia Sarah tries to make easier, with performing simple, but frequent commands. This technology is accessible on both smartphones, computers and recently in household appliances and cars as well.

        "abstract": "Research and development in bionics are crucial for individuals with disabilities, aiding in the restoration or augmentation of physical functions. The functioning of human body parts is akin to robots, responding to various signals and performing movements. By capturing and controlling these electrical impulses, we can transmit them to areas where direct connection is severed or integrate them into devices. The aim of my thesis is to demonstrate the control of a 3D-printed hand using real-time video from a camera, enabling robotic finger movements based on human hand movement. Additionally, it allows extraction of hand movement information from EMG signals, enabling control of the robotic hand with a microcontroller. The device processes EMG signals, and a 3D model and necessary software have been developed to process camera images and control the motors for appropriate finger movement. The thesis introduces the concept of bionics and its relevance, drawing parallels between the human body and robots, and emphasizing the role of electrical impulses in movement. It reviews relevant literature, focusing on neuromuscular processes, anatomy, and principles of electromyography (EMG), including types of EMG electrodes and muscle electrical activity. It provides an overview of the electronic components used, such as operational amplifiers, filters, and analog-to-digital conversion, discussing electronic noise management. Image processing techniques for controlling the robotic hand are explored, detailing digital signal processing and system integration. Specifications and system architecture are discussed, including functional and non-functional requirements, and choices for models and motors. The microcontrollers and EMG sensors used are also described. System design includes preparing the 3D model of the hand, testing the motors, processing signals, and integrating EMG electrodes. Firmware development focuses on implementing the WiFi access point, ADC reading, and spike detection of the EMG signal. Software development for image processing and data transmission to the microcontroller is also covered, describing thresholding techniques for detecting hand movements. The implementation and experimental results chapter outlines installation steps and system performance measurements. The final chapter provides general conclusions and suggests future work, discussing possible system improvements and extensions, such as integrating additional sensors and advanced signal processing algorithms. It compares similar devices and analyzes potential development directions. This project demonstrates the feasibility of controlling a 3D-printed robotic hand using EMG signals and image processing, opening new opportunities for advanced prosthetic devices.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the accounting sector has seen significant advancements, now employing much more modern applications to handle incoming data with greater ease and efficiency, facilitating their utilization and recording. There are already applications that streamline the accountant’s tasks with just a press of a button or a few clicks. Recently, the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has become widespread in accounting. These technologies have revolutionizedtheprocessingoffinancialdata. OCRtechnologyallowsfortheextractionoftext from scanned documents, whether they are invoices or receipts, enabling automatic data entry and reducing errors associated with manual input. AI algorithms provide substantial assistance in accelerating processes that would otherwise be more time-consuming for humans. However, these technologies are not infallible and may require human intervention to ensure acceptable results. The aim of my thesis is to leverage the aforementioned technologies to simplify the work of accountants through a straightforward user-friendly web environment. The application allows for the scanning and processing of key invoice data (such as invoice number, due date, total amount, buyer/seller information). The extracted text from invoices can also be translated into other languages, as the application was designed for universal use, accessible even to accountants who speak foreign languages. The system’s backend is Python-based, while the frontend utilizes JavaScript and the React framework. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. The optical character recognition technologies used include the well-known Tesseract and DocTR. AI-based technologies include DeepL for translation and ChatPDF for answering queries related to uploaded invoices.",

This requires sampled data collection and I used “Muse 2” headband in order to sample and collect this data. It was asked a woman and a man for the data collection and both of them made the same experiment. I processed the raw data, then I used it to build and teach an artificial neural network, which was created with the help of Tensorflow and Keras frameworks. The secondary aim of the dissertation is to examine the spectrum of the samples and apply different transformations, then to compare them. Based on previous research I examined the processing of continuous and discrete signals and placed more emphasis on discrete transformations. Based on my results (70-80% recognition efficiency), in order for the neural network to be as accurate as possible, it is necessary to collect more data, classify them into classes by providing them in a more optimal way. To reach this goal, in the future I would like to develop a set of rules from the collected data and to classify my data based on these rules, and so I hope to achieve greater recognition efficiency.",

Nowadays, people spend a large part of their day under the influence of digitalization. Most people have at least a smartphone, a PC, or a laptop, and with these, they also have access to the internet, which provides infinite possibilities. Digitalization introduces many benefits for humanity—problems can be solved using the internet and digital devices, for example: paying bills, maintaining relationships with relatives, and, not least, with the help of virtual tours, visiting places they could never physically go. This dissertation is about a web application that uses and displays a 3D model of the university building, creating a virtual tour. Anyone can attend this tour, offering the possibility to explore the building from anywhere. Besides this, the application has an informational purpose, as it provides a lot of information about the university, for example: events (like Sapi Line-Tracer), or the names and contact details of the specialist coordinators. The application includes a feature called “Take me!”, which guides the user to a selected location and shows the route to get there, greatly helping visitors. Additionally, users can freely navigate through the 3D model and discover the entire virtual environment. The system was developed for web platforms, allowing it to be used on almost any device, such as PCs, laptops, and smartphones. The application can provide significant help for new students, as well as for visiting students and teachers, to quickly familiarize themselves with the university’s main building.",

        "abstract": "These days, the majority of shopping is done online. There are tons of online shopping websites, with some kind of big sale going on almost all the time; however, these sales are most of the time made up. These false sales can be spotted only if you follow a product’s price daily for a longer period, which is a repetitive and time-consuming process. The same applies when you’re interested in purchasing products but are undecided and want to wait for a price drop. These gave the inspiration for developing our system. In this paper, we present a price monitoring system that automates the process described earlier. At predefined moments, the system wakes up and scrapes publicly available data from the Internet, which is then saved. The user can add products to their list to be followed and view the price changes on a chart. All this can be done from a Chrome browser extension or a mobile application built with Flutter. The core of the system is a Python script responsible for mining the data, periodically updating prices, and pushing new products into the database. All this is done while respecting moral and legal boundaries. All our data is stored in a Realtime Database provided by Firebase, which proved perfect for our application. After months of gathering data while using the system, we analyzed it and made several conclusions. We observed multiple patterns in price changes, but no single pattern matches every product. There were many scams regarding prices, especially during Black Friday, but also real and significant price drops. After using the system for a longer time, we can say software like this helps buyers make purchase decisions by providing useful data in an easy-to-read form.",

Our goal was to develop an efficient classifier, which is a neural network created by our own model, or a neural network with GoogleNet architecture, trained for our own purposes using “transfer learning” technique. Our research methodology was based on studying existing solutions, conducting our own experiments and collecting data. We applied the transfer learning technique to the GoogleNet architecture, which is a pre-trained large model, thus improving the classification accuracy. Data collection was performed using chest X-rays of pneumonia and asymptomatic cases. Based on the results, we were able to develop a graphical user interface that allows automaticclassificationofchestradiographsanddiagnosisofpneumonia. Theneuralnetwork with GoogleNet architecture achieved outstanding accuracy on the tested dataset, and compared to our own classification network, produced significantly better results, similar to the results of the networks studied in the literature. Based on these results, we conclude that a well-written neural network interoperating with the GoogleNet architecture can effectively detect pneumonia based on chest X-ray. This research could contribute to the improvement of medical diagnostics, helping early detection and more effective treatment.",

The aim of the dissertation is to process the routes of the vehicles in such a way that conclusions can be drawn from them, withthe helpof whichrelevant data(averagespeed, curve coordinates) can be filtered out. The available data set is made up of different data (coordinate, speed, consumption, direction). The developed algorithm can be used to reduce the data set without losing statistically important data. The most important data contains the coordinates that result in a route change. The solution is able to detect bendsfrom whichitcan generate significantstatistics(averagespeed in a curve). As a result, it is able to compare different routes and suggest new ones.

The aim is to develop a complementary system for remote patient monitoring and controlling which can act fully as a noninvasive artificial respiration assistant, representing a new approach in the field of mechanical ventilators. We have combined a completely new concept ventilation mechanism with a modern ESP32 microcontroller-based control system and a program installed on a mobile graphical user interface that allows these machines to be easily carried, operated, and controlled, while also providing closed-loop breath control. Two-way remote monitoring and control based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology allows an authorized physician connected to a wireless network to monitor respiratory parameters and adjust settings in real time, track multiple patients simultaneously, or even make clinical decisions without having to come into direct contact with the device or the patient.

In our days the concept of security it becomes more and more important in every area of our life, therefore the preservation of this, takes precedence keeping our human life. The acceleration of the world, involves the increase of meetings and contacts between people and the regular formation of this. An exponential increase of these contacts resulting from these meetings becomes a defining motive of our accelerated world. Unfortunately, in some cases it creates a negative effect in our lives, it can prevent the opportunity of preserving the security. The frequently encounters, the multitude of contacts between people, in some cases can be a threat to our heath and the safety of our material assets. During the creation of my license thesis, my goal was the implementation of an application which, with the help of Bluetooth technology, can follow where and with whom we meet and pursues a certain time limit, which we are spending with a certain person. If it is necessary warns the users about a potential contact that could pose a danger of their safety. The application was successfully implemented in the Android development environment, with the help of Bluetooth technology integrated in the smartphones. As a result, we get a phone application running on an Android operating system which can be used in case of pandemic, or in any case when is required the contact research, but it can also be used even for personal reason for the tracking of our own movements and meetings.",

        "abstract": "In human life, one of the most important and valuable things is time. In today's fast-paced world, events have become so accelerated that it is truly challenging to keep them under control and manage our time effectively. To save time, numerous smart devices and systems have emerged, making people's lives easier. We can even say that we are living in the era of smart systems. My thesis’ topic encompasses such a system. It helps us not only to save time, but also relieves us from a responsibility. This modern and innovative solution allows us to take care of our plants in the best possible way while minimizing the tasks of plant care and maximizing the health and beauty of our flowers. It assists in maintaining the plants in optimal condition, especially when we are not at home or don't have enough time for their care. The system's sensors and controllers monitor the environmental parameters of the plants, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and their watering needs. The smart flowerpot system automatically regulates watering, ensuring that the plants always receive the right amount of water at the right time. We no longer need to worry about overwatering or underwatering, as the system takes precise care of watering our flowers. Through an interactive and user interface, we can easily set the watering schedule, monitor the plants' condition, and track the environmental parameters. Whether we are at home or away, the system allows remote access, enabling us to stay connected with our flowers and intervene when necessary. For the control of the system, I have used an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is an extremely versatile and powerful platform that enables full control and monitoring of my smart flowerpot system.",

The goal of the project was to create a portfolio page that uses modern technologies and is therefore easy to use, responsive and dynamic at the same time. The development was made in the Vue.js framework and Typescript language, the backend tasks are provided by Firebase, mainly through the Firestore database. This allows administrators to modify the various contents of the website without basic programming knowledge. The website can be divided into several parts: the main page contains the presentation of the works, the introduction, the description of the services, and the contact information. Administrators can dynamically change data using various pre-made templates. The website is responsive, so it is easy to use and transparent on desktop computers, tablets and smartphones. In the documentation, I tried to present the technological background in sufficient detail, such as Firebase Hosting and the security measures that guarantee data protection. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate how to easily and efficiently create and manage a dynamic website using modern software development tools. The finished website was named \"DynaCraftHub\", which refers to the possibility of dynamic data upload, and is of course accessible through Firebase services.",

A page may be browsed by 100 people in one minute and increase to 100,000 in the next minute. A modern website needs to sense this and increase or decrease the resources allocated, depending on the load. The dissertation presents a scalable web application based onKubernetes,during the creationof which I created a webshop, and then I containerized it and deployed it to a local Kubernetes cluster. The webshop allows you to browse and search for products belonging to different categories, display a specific product in detail, add products to the cart, register, login and pay by credit card. I used Spring Boot framework for the server sideof theapplication. On theclient sideI usedthe Angular framework. For the database I used a relational MySQL database. To implement the containerization, I used Docker to create the containers that are the basis for deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster. I solved the deployment to the Kubernetes cluster with Minikube, which allowed me to use Kubernetes locally for free. In the dissertation I write in detail about the technologies used, mainly about Kubernetes and Docker, the implementation of functions, the architecture and the results achieved.",

        "abstract": "Industrial robots are more and more wide-spread in various manufacturing and logistics processes, where accuracy, speed, and safety are important factors. Robots are capable of automating tasks that are boring, dangerous, or too complex for humans. However, the collaboration between robots and humans represents challenges, especially when robots need to adapt flexibly to changing environments and tasks. The recognition and manipulation of small objects are tasks widely used in industrial and educational contexts. However, determining the type and positioning of these objects is not always straightforward, particularly when they have similar colors or sizes. In this paper, I present a method that enables the Baxter robot to easily differentiate cubes using ArUco markers. I describe how I programmed the Baxter robot to determine the type and position of cubes on a workspace and arrange them accordingly. Throughout my study, I provide a detailed presentation of the system's design, implementation, and testing. In my paper, I have developed a system that can control the Baxter robot to recognize and manipulate cuboid-shaped objects. The system consists of three main components: an image processing module that detects and identifies objects using the OpenCV and cv2.aruco libraries, a communication module that uses the ZMQ protocol to send and receive data, and a robot control module that utilizes the ROS (Robot Operating System) libraries to control the robot's arms and grippers. During the operation of the system, the robot captures an image of the workspace, determines the position and type of objects, and performs sorting based on this information.",

Such useful applications are, for example, applications for paying our bills, but we can also find many applications for managing our day-to-day tasks. Mobile applications not only make our everyday lives easier but can also be helpful in educational institutions. The most commonly used mobile applications in schools and universities are various calculators, translators, and note-taking applications. However, applications for presenting PowerPoint presentations are not widespread among people, so their number is very small and they are not the best maintained or do not have many features that would make the use of these applications meaningful other than that the user does not have to keep a separate device with them. My thesis aims to design a system that allows laser pointers to be used on PowerPoint presentation slides with the help of our smartphone regardless of whether we have an Android or IOS phone. In addition, it should allow switching between slides and drawing on them. The system consists of two components: one part is the server, which receives and processes data sent by our phone; the other part is the phone, which detects the user’s hand movements with the help of the accelerometer in the phone and also sends the pressing of displayed buttons to the server via WiFi. The data required to connect to the server is made possible by scanning the QR code generated by the server.",

In current times, with the increase in inflation, the prices of all necessities have risen, especially electricity. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to our daily energy consumption and do not make changes in our energy usage habits, we can easily encounter financial difficulties. The aim of my thesis is to develop an IoT (Internet of Things) system that enables easy measurement and monitoring of energy consumption of electronic devices within a household. Additionally, the system is capable of monitoring the production of solar panels installed in the household. The data is stored in a database, allowing for future statistical analysis and insights. This provides a more accurate understanding of energy costs and helps optimize consumption while leveraging renewable energy sources. The different units communicate with each other through the MQTT protocol, where publishers (household appliances, solar panels) send sampled data to the broker (Raspberry Pi), where the data is processed, stored in a MongoDB database, and the processed data is sent to a mobile application via a REST API service.",

In addition, phones can be equipped with various accessories associated with new sensors, making it possible to continuously monitor vital signs. The purpose of this diploma work is to develop a system that would benefit from the possibilities offered by sensors. The Stroke Monitor application includes two different software, which consists of a telephone application and a smartwatch application, their interaction allowing the user to monitor their heart rate even outside the hospital. The purpose of monitoring is to inform the user and the contact person in case of a possible risk of stroke which is implemented based on the data provided by the smartwatch and processed by the telephone application. It plays an important role for vulnerable users, because early medical emergency measures reduce the aftermath of stroke. The telephone application is also able to display various graphs, determine the risk score, provide daily advice to prevent the risk of stroke. During the development of the system, we used flutter technology, so the application is platform independent.
