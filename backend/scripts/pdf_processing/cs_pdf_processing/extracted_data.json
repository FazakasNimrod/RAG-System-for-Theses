        "abstract": "This paper describes in detail a system and its architecture for managing direction change and\nbraking signals on scooters and bicycles, using a sensor with an accelerometer and gyroscope on\nthe back of the hand. The project aims to provide a solution for direction signals on the crank\nwithout removing the hand from the handlebars, thus avoiding the resulting accidents. The user is\nable to indicate a change of direction by gestures such as turning the hand sideways, so that it is\nnot necessary to take the hand completely off the steering wheel, thus maintaining the balance of\nthe vehicle. Brake signals are automatic as a result of acceleration sensing. The system uses two\nmicrocontrollers (ESP32 and ESP8266), one of which processes the sensor data, while the other\nruns a web server and lights the corresponding LEDs. The web server is responsible for the\ncommunication between the microcontrollers and also runs a web page that acts as a user interface.\nOn the web page, active signals such as turn signals and brake signals are displayed and can be\nswitched on and off. Communication between the different components is wireless using WiFi\ntechnology.",

        "abstract": "A significant proportion of biological phenomena can be traced back to genetics,\nwhich is based on gene sequences. Decoding these gene sequences represents a\nsubstantial challenge in the field of biological sciences. According to a bold estimate, this\ntask could potentially engage the scientific community for the next five hundred years.\nThe aim of my thesis is to implement a simple gene sequence classification\nalgorithm and integrate this algorithm into a software, equipped with a graphical user\ninterface. This may represent a small step toward the solution of decoding gene\nsequences.\nThis implemented algorithm performs classification based on similarity data from\ngene sequence pairs within a larger sequence dataset. This methodology allows us to\nsimultaneously process large amount of protein sequences and grouping these sequences\nbased on their similarity. This is made possible by working with sparse matrices which\neliminates unnecessary operations, such as addition and multiplication with zero. At the\nsame time, this method has significant memory efficiency, because we only store the\nnone zero values.\nThis method treats the input sequence dataset as a graph. Each protein is assigned\na node within the graph, and the initial edges between the nodes are received as input\ndata from the SCOP95 database. These values were created using the BLAST algorithm\nand they’re form a sparse matrix. This algorithm is a modified form of Markov\nclustering, in which the two main operations, inflation and expansion, work against each\nother. Connected subgraphs remaining in the equilibrium state, defining the final result of\nthe clustering. The main parameter of the algorithm is the inflation rate, which\ndetermines how much the algorithm separates groups from each other.\nThe graphical user interface provides the opportunity to perform the classification\non the 11,944-element SCOP95 dataset or on its subparts, using various settings and can\ndisplay these resulting protein groups. Furthermore, from any group, we can select two\nsequences and observe the results of their alignment, which is implemented using the\nNeedleman-Wunsch algorithm.\nThe algorithm could process up to one million protein sequences in a few hours,\nbut unfortunately an appropriate real dataset was not available for this purpose.",

These systems would enable more\naccurate and efficient diagnoses during the identification and treatment of these diseases. The\nfoundation of my approach is the utilization of electrocardiography (ECG) signals in medicine.\nThese signals provide precise and detailed information about the heart's electrical activity,\nmaking it possible to detect various heart diseases or other abnormalities.\nThe first step involves preprocessing the signals, applying filtering and other normalization\ntechniques. Then, I create an RGB color-channel image, a spectrogram. The spectrogram is a\nvisual representation that shows the frequency spectrum of the signal over time. Different shades\nof color in the channels indicate the intensity of the frequencies, making it easier to analyze the\nstructure and changes of the signal. This process helps extract essential information from the\nsignals and reduces distortions caused by noise.\nThese images serve as the input dataset for my deep learning-based training software, whose\nmain task is to recognize four specific diseases.

In today's fast-paced\nworld, events have become so accelerated that it is truly challenging to keep them under control\nand manage our time effectively. To save time, numerous smart devices and systems have\nemerged, making people's lives easier. We can even say that we are living in the era of smart\nsystems.\nMy thesis’ topic encompasses such a system. It helps us not only to save time, but also\nrelieves us from a responsibility. This modern and innovative solution allows us to take care of\nour plants in the best possible way while minimizing the tasks of plant care and maximizing the\nhealth and beauty of our flowers. It assists in maintaining the plants in optimal condition, especially\nwhen we are not at home or don't have enough time for their care. The system's sensors and\ncontrollers monitor the environmental parameters of the plants, such as temperature, humidity,\nlight intensity, and their watering needs.\nThe smart flowerpot system automatically regulates watering, ensuring that the plants\nalways receive the right amount of water at the right time. We no longer need to worry about\noverwatering or underwatering, as the system takes precise care of watering our flowers.\nThrough an interactive and user interface, we can easily set the watering schedule, monitor\nthe plants' condition, and track the environmental parameters. Whether we are at home or away,\nthe system allows remote access, enabling us to stay connected with our flowers and intervene\nwhen necessary.\nFor the control of the system, I have used an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is an\nextremely versatile and powerful platform that enables full control and monitoring of my smart\nflowerpot system.",

        "abstract": "Industrial robots are more and more wide-spread in various manufacturing and logistics processes,\nwhere accuracy, speed, and safety are important factors. Robots are capable of automating tasks\nthat are boring, dangerous, or too complex for humans. However, the collaboration between robots\nand humans represents challenges, especially when robots need to adapt flexibly to changing\nenvironments and tasks.\nThe recognition and manipulation of small objects are tasks widely used in industrial and\neducational contexts. However, determining the type and positioning of these objects is not always\nstraightforward, particularly when they have similar colors or sizes. In this paper, I present a\nmethod that enables the Baxter robot to easily differentiate cubes using ArUco markers. I describe\nhow I programmed the Baxter robot to determine the type and position of cubes on a workspace\nand arrange them accordingly. Throughout my study, I provide a detailed presentation of the\nsystem's design, implementation, and testing.\nIn my paper, I have developed a system that can control the Baxter robot to recognize and\nmanipulate cuboid-shaped objects. The system consists of three main components: an image\nprocessing module that detects and identifies objects using the OpenCV and cv2.aruco libraries, a\ncommunication module that uses the ZMQ protocol to send and receive data, and a robot control\nmodule that utilizes the ROS (Robot Operating System) libraries to control the robot's arms and\ngrippers. During the operation of the system, the robot captures an image of the workspace,\ndetermines the position and type of objects, and performs sorting based on this information.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, everyone has a smartphone that can solve many problems with various\napplications. Such useful applications are, for example, applications for paying our bills, but we\ncan also find many applications for managing our day-to-day tasks.\nMobile applications not only make our everyday lives easier but can also be helpful in\neducational institutions. The most commonly used mobile applications in schools and universities\nare various calculators, translators, and note-taking applications.\nHowever, applications for presenting PowerPoint presentations are not widespread among\npeople, so their number is very small and they are not the best maintained or do not have many\nfeatures that would make the use of these applications meaningful other than that the user does not\nhave to keep a separate device with them.\nMy thesis aims to design a system that allows laser pointers to be used on PowerPoint\npresentation slides with the help of our smartphone regardless of whether we have an Android or\nIOS phone. In addition, it should allow switching between slides and drawing on them. The system\nconsists of two components: one part is the server, which receives and processes data sent by our\nphone; the other part is the phone, which detects the user’s hand movements with the help of the\naccelerometer in the phone and also sends the pressing of displayed buttons to the server via WiFi.\nThe data required to connect to the server is made possible by scanning the QR code generated by\nthe server.",

        "abstract": "In the modern and rapidly evolving world, there is electric technology behind all our\nneeds, hobbies, and work, which we use comfortably and without problems. In current times,\nwith the increase in inflation, the prices of all necessities have risen, especially electricity.\nTherefore, if we do not pay attention to our daily energy consumption and do not make changes\nin our energy usage habits, we can easily encounter financial difficulties.\nThe aim of my thesis is to develop an IoT (Internet of Things) system that enables easy\nmeasurement and monitoring of energy consumption of electronic devices within a household.\nAdditionally, the system is capable of monitoring the production of solar panels installed in the\nhousehold. The data is stored in a database, allowing for future statistical analysis and insights.\nThis provides a more accurate understanding of energy costs and helps optimize consumption\nwhile leveraging renewable energy sources.\nThe different units communicate with each other through the MQTT protocol, where\npublishers (household appliances, solar panels) send sampled data to the broker (Raspberry Pi),\nwhere the data is processed, stored in a MongoDB database, and the processed data is sent to a\nmobile application via a REST API service.",
