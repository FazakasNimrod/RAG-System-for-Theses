In order to live a healthy life, we all choose different sports, in which we invest energy and time every day. Physical exercise has proven to not only havephysical benefits, but also significant effects on mental health, furthermore the people we do sports with can determine the quality of the time we spend exercising.[25] Choosing the right community for doing sports and everyday activities is a challange that everyone faces, since it great impact on our lives. The purpose of this is thesis is providing a platform that serves as a middleware for people that want to connect with others, and fight the problem of not having company to exercise. Cronotus provides an online platform where people can easily overcome the problem of not having company to exercise. The application allows one to organize, search for sports events, so that we can make sure that no one is left home because they had no one to go out with. The project also aims to make certain events easy to follow, providing organizers with the opportunity to provide up-to-date information to athletes, which can help the community to find the events that are most suitable for them.",

Their development can assist, for example, radiologists in identifying tumors or determining tumor types in brain MRI images. In my thesis, I compare three convolutional neural networks of varying complexity on two datasets which were developed by others, and I investigate which one performs the best. My measurements show that on the Kaggle dataset, VGG16 and ComplexCNN perform very similarly, achieving F1-scores of 1 and 0.99, respectively, while SimpleCNN has an F1-score of 0.90. On the Figshare dataset, ComplexCNN and SimpleCNN are measured, with SimpleCNN achieving an F1-score of 0.92 and ComplexCNN achieving 0.97. My measurements contradict the developers of ComplexCNN, who claim in their study that ComplexCNN performs better on image classification tasks than VGG16 and all other networks. In addition to the research, a proof of concept (POC) software was also developed. This software allows users to test the selected network in a browser with a brain MRI image and it visually illustrates the classification result.",

Everycompanyhasitsemployeesandeverycompanyaimsforefficientmanage- ment of human resources and the work performed by employees, with a unified interface where everything can be easily managed. As each company has its own preferences, these can only be maximally satisfied with an application that can be easily personalized. The aim of my thesis is to create a mobile application that can be integrated with a web-based ERP system which helps companies track the work done by employees and facilitate communication, both in the form of messages and documents. The foundation of the web system is an Odoo framework-based website, where man- agement has been handled up to now. The problem arose when they couldn’t accurately account for the work done and employees had to log in to the website to send a message or attach a document to a completed task. This led to the idea of greatly simplifying and enhancing the workflow with an application where employees can do all this without needing to connect to a website from their phones. To implement this, I developed a native Android application in Kotlin, utilizing a local Room database, connected via XMLRPC to the web interface where data is stored in PostgreSQL. I also had to create a module for the web interface, acting as an API between the Odoo system and my application. This module was written in Python.

The system aims to enhance coordination and engagement among university members, particularly teachers and staff. The website provides administrators with the ability to add, update, and remove events, while teachers can register themselves as attendees and track their participation history. The system centralizes event details, including event type, location, date, expected number of attendees, and comprehensive descriptions. Bystreamliningeventorganizationandimprovingcommunication,theevent management system contributes to a more cohesive and engaged academic community within the department. The event management system serves as a centralized platform for administrators to efficiently manage departmental events. They can easily add new events, update event information, and remove past events, providing a comprehensive overview of the department’s activities. Teachers benefit from the system by having access to a personalized dashboard where they can view upcoming events, track their attendance history, and manage their participation in various activities. This centralized approach to event management fills the gap that previously existed, allowing teachers to easily track the number and types of events they have participated in.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis consists of the use of the eigenface method, which is an important part of the principal component analysis (PCA). The face is one of the most important characteristics of the human body. Usually, by examining the human face, people can decide if a person is known or unknown to them. Recently, thanks to the development of technology and the world, people meet hundreds of human faces daily. With the knowledge of this fact, the question of whether there is a way in which the properties of the human face can be used in the virtual world arises. In studying the human face, significant aspects are the determination of different organs’ position and the determination of the specific characteristics (ex. birthmark). The analysis and the knowledge of these elements help a lot in people’s identification both in the real and the virtual life. People daily meet with a big amount of information and the human life is getting much more dependent on the elements of the virtual world. Thanks to these things, the identification of people and the access to different places to be done by using the properties of the human face was just a matter of time. In this thesis I will attempt to answer the question of whether the eigenface method deserves to be used as a part of a two-factor authentication (2FA) or not. The method will be used as the system’s first security factor, which consists of the detection of human face and of the recognition of a specific person. During the implementation, the main goal will be to make face recognition more efficient and precise. Based on the results, I will conclude if the technology used in my research is worth to be used and, based on my own results, if it is possible for the created system to be developed in a certain way.",

        "abstract": "In this thesis, we have explored the possibility of using human-machine interfaces as a new approach to password-free secure access and user authentication. In the pro- posed approach, the active interface, which monitors some biometric process, serves as a non-transferable authentication token based on a secure “dead man switch”. If the connection is terminated, the system automatically revokes the privileges and logs the user out. To avoid forgery and impersonation, the system uses a one-time key protected communication protocol between the clients and the server managing access to resources. In this research, we analyzed possible solutions based on the criteria of security, convenience and cost-effectiveness, and implemented a system based on a comfortable wearable visual cortex activity monitor and a low-cost heart rate monitoring system. The completed systems were tested to assess their reliability and safety. The results of the research show that the combination of non-transferable authenti- cation tokens, biometrics and communication protocol offers a promising alternative to password or simple token-based access control systems, as it improves security and allows for more flexible security roles, such as temporary authorised security roles.",

Nowadays, stu- dents are growing up alongside digital technologies, using smartphones, playing computer games, and actively participating in the online world. Compared to previous decades, forms of entertainment have undergone significant changes, greatly influencing modern education. Teachers need to employ new methods and techniques to sustain interest and stimulate further learning. Gamification, or the use of game elements, is a very impor- tant component of modern education and can provide an effective solution to changing teaching needs. I conducted a research study among students in Transylvania, where I gathered their opinions on the usefulness of various game elements in relation to learning. These game elements are all associated with gamification. Based on my own experiences, educational games can greatly assist the learning process. Their greatest advantage is that they allow learning useful things in a highly en- joyable and playful manner. My goal was to create an educational game that incorporates the game elements found to be advantageous in my research. The purpose of the game I developed is to help users grasp the basics of the C pro- gramming language. The protagonist of the game is a university student named UniTiby, whomtheusercancontrol. Beforeeachtask,theplayerreceivesthenecessaryinformation to solve the given level. Each lesson is accompanied by a maze. The user is presented with questions and tasks that require decision-making, but by utilizing the new information, they can navigate through the maze. The main objective of the educational game is to avoid monotony, which is why it features highly diverse environments. Environmental elements also appear randomly.",

Several bot detection systems are known using different methods to distinguish humans from bots based on website usage data. Most websites use some image or audio recognition techniques or character recog- nition to distinguish humans from bots. This is because there is no system yet which is able to detect bots exclusively by mouse movements. Although, this is a widely interested topic because with such a system there will be no need anymore to recognize image or au- dio nor any cookie checking like how Google bot detection works, just a simple checkbox click would be enough. So in this thesis I would like to analyze mouse dynamics performed by users inside a web application, I will illustrate them, examine what kind of features could I extract from them to classify users more precisely. Then, try some method to generate synthetic mouse movement data set similar to humans in order to deceive bot detectors. Based on user classification results we can conclude that user recognition based on mouse dynamics has a low accuracy. However, using features related to the screen resolutionimprovestherecognitionaccuracy. SynthetictrajectoriesbasedonBéziercurves can be easily detected by almost any classifier.",

Human personality is the phenomenon that makes us unique. Each person has a different personality, and while there may be similar personalities, no two people are exactly alike in the world. This phenomenon determines how we feel, think, and behave in different situations. How we see the world, communicate with others, and respond to challenges all stem from our personality. Many factors influence a person’s personality: genetics, family background, friends, experiences, and life events all shape it. The Eysenck Personality Test application attempts to measure specific dimensions of personality, providing insight into an individual’s characteristic ways of thinking and behaving. Its goal is to help users better understand themselves, track the development or changes in their personalities, and gain a better understanding of how they react to different life situations. While using the application, the user has one task: to honestly answer the test questions, without overthinking them, as responses should be based on initialimpressions. Anotherimportantaspectisthatthepersonalitytestrequiresmultiple completions to examine different measurements. The results I get from the application help me examine the differences and similar- ities in the two entities personality traits. The aim of the research is to understand the consistencyandvalidityofpersonalitytraitsbasedonrepeatedcompletionsbycomparing these two entities. Analyzing the differences in test results provides valuable insights into how these personality tests can be used to better understand personality traits and the functioning of language models. The application is very easy to use, and the test can be completed in a few minutes, with users receiving immediate results. After logging in, users can immediately respond to questions with \"YES\" or \"NO\" answers, and upon completion, they can compare their current result with previous ones if they already did the test before.",

        "abstract": "In my thesis I take a closer look at distance-based similarity metrics used in image recognition by comparing them on different image classification tasks. Nowadays there is a significant interest towards the research of image recognition techniques, because they contribute to the development of modern autonomous systems. There are numerous challenges with a wide range of difficulties facing this technology, but thanks to high computational power, modern computers can outperform human recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in certain situations. Recent innovations rely frequently on image recognitionmethods,whichallowedforthedevelopmentoftechnologiessuchasAdvanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), biometric authentication and image-based medical diagnostic tools. By taking a picture’s pixel values we can perform mathematical computations and even measure similarity between two instances by using different kinds of formulas. In order to quantify the similarity, first, we need to measure a distance. The two images will be similar, if the distance between them is small enough. Taking this into account, when working with a labeled dataset, we can classify a new image just by assigning the label of the most similar image to it. With a high accuracy this can lead to image recognition. In order to achieve this, there is need for the development of fast, efficient and reliable algorithms. InthisworkIamcomparingdifferentdistancemetricsforthecomputationofsimilar- ities. Alongside the traditional distance measures, such as the Euclidean, the Manhattan and the Cosine measures, I experiment with the usage of dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on images. In all the cases I will be using a nearest neighbor classifier, which will handle the classification process of the images, based on the calculated similarities. The experiments will be carried out on two image datasets: one containing hand- written digits, and one with human facial expressions. By using a 10-fold cross validation testing protocol, I will be measuring the run times, the mean and the standard deviation of recognition accuracies. I will make conclusions based on the results and highlight the best performing dis- tance metrics, but I will also demonstrate the hidden potential of using DTW on image recognition tasks. Together with my advisor, we also created a scientific poster about this thesis, which we took to the 13th Dubrovnik Conference on Cognitive Science (DUCOG 2022). Here I presented the concept of emotion recognition based on images of facial expressions to the participants, who gave positive feedback regarding the research and the usability of the technology.",

        "abstract": "Thegoaloftheprojectistocreateamobileapplicationthatallowsuserstoefficiently manage their food stocks, thereby promoting conscious shopping and reducing waste. When designing the application, a key consideration was that it should be easy and intuitive to use for all users. The app’s main features include user account management, which allows you to register and log in, as well as track your personal food inventory. Users can list and sort their products by expiration date, so they can easily see when a product expires. In addition, it is possible to add new products, modify or delete existing ones in the digital storeroom. Categorization and grouping of products is also possible, which helps users in terms of transparency and organization. Another important element of the application is household management, where mul- tiple users can collaborate and manage a shared inventory. This way, a family or room- mates can easily share and manage purchases together, optimizing food consumption and minimizing unnecessary purchases. In order to reduce conscious shopping and waste, the application can also send no- tifications about products that are about to expire, thus drawing the user’s attention to use them as soon as possible. This not only reduces food waste, but also makes it easier for users to manage stocks and develop more sustainable consumption habits. To develop the application, I used the latest technological tools, including Node.js and Express.js for the development of the backend part, as well as the Flutter framework for the implementation of the responsive frontend. I chose MongoDB to manage the database, as its flexible data model and scalability were ideal for meeting the project’s needs. Overall, the application not only helps users to efficiently manage and organize their food stocks, but also indirectly contributes to the development of more sustainable consumption habits, thereby reducing unnecessary food waste and supporting conscious shopping. The project resulted in a modern, user-friendly application that offers an effective and innovative solution to a real social problem.",

        "abstract": "Demand forecasting is an extremely important and valuable activity in many in- dustries and business environments. Accurate forecasting allows companies to effectively manage inventory, optimise their design and manufacturing processes, develop sales and marketing strategies, reduce costs and increase efficiency. One of the main benefits of demand forecasting is the ability to manage inventory efficiently, as it allows companies to minimise stock shortages and overstocks, optimise stock levels and reduce storage and warehousing costs. Demand forecasting also helps to optimise design and production pro- cesses. Forecasting allows companies to plan their production capacity, adjust production schedules and make more efficient use of available resources. It also enables companies to better understand their customers’ needs and behaviour. This allows the development of personalised product offerings, the optimisation of sales and marketing strategies and the delivery of a better customer experience. It helps companies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty by enabling companies to accurately reach and meet customer needs based on predictions. Effective inventory management is partly based on good demand forecasting. Not only does insufficient inventory cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenue, but if it happens often enough, or at an important enough time for a customer, it can also result in the loss of future business. However, oversupply is costly in terms of storage and logistics, and some stock can remain unsold for a long time - or even forever - resulting in a total loss of investment. Finding the right stock balance is therefore an essential aspect of good demand forecasting. Over the years, there have been significant developments in the field of demand forecasting. Thecontinuousdevelopmentofforecastingmethodsandtechniques,aswellas the increase in the quantity and quality of data available, has had a significant impact on theaccuracyandreliabilityofforecasting. Inaddition,improvementsindatamanagement and processing have also led to significant progress. Developments in data mining and machine learning algorithms allow the analysis of complex data sets and the identification of hidden patterns, thus helping to produce more accurate and reliable forecasts. The aim of this paper is to predict the future demand distribution of some prod- ucts by demonstrating the process of creating a time series forecast using the Amazon Forecast web service, which does not require prior knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The paper presents the complete process required to produce the forecasts, including the associated logic, and the desktop application designed to manage the Forecast by communicating with the service. The results of the forecasts are displayed and interpreted.",

And at the society level, it is essential to synchronise people’s availability, for example in the hospitality industry, in the surgery or in programming in other premises. My thesis focuses on the presentation of a planner application developed for the Christian foundation Exodus, which offers a solution to the limitations and shortcomings of the methods they use. My goal was to develop a system that provides an IT solution beyond Excel spreadsheets that is open to managing a wide range of teams and events. My main task is to create a web application that allows the visualization of teams and events using graphical representation. This application will facilitate the workflow of my clients by presenting the data generated by the server to the users in a clear and efficient way.

The goal of my work was to develop a method whereby a GPS-less minidrone can navigate a primarily human-use indoor environment based on visual input alone with enough accuracy to reliably perform the task of even a hydroelectric monitoring robot. The drone follows a predetermined path, presumably inaccurately as it is not equipped with GPS. To be more precise, it can reposition itself using QR codes placed at critical positions along the route and then continue on its way.",

Digitization is very prominent and important for the operation of businesses and institutions.

The software extracts the data from the document during every upload, resulting in a computerized text file. Before the application saves the data from the document, it extracts the entities (people, institutions, dates, etc.) from the text. Furthermore, it creates a summary of the text, which is useful in case someone does not wish to read the entire text. The other important function of the software is browsing the documents. Users can search for, view and download documents uploaded by other users. When creating the software, I have made use of artificial intelligence and integrated several libraries into the application, all of which contribute to creating a state-of-the-art software. The software is made of two parts: an Angular application on the client’s end and a REST API on the server’s end. This gives it the advantage that it can be further developed on the client’s end, with a mobile application, for example.",

One of the most popular logic games today, the Hungarian invention, which has been extremely successful worldwide since the 1980s, is a three-dimensional logic game. The goal is simple, but all the more challenging: to bring the cube to its original state after random shuffling, which has long been considered impossible. Which one solution we choose depends entirely on what level we are at, how many algorithms we want to keep in mind, how fast we want to solve it, or whether we want to solve the cube blindly or with one hand? The algorithm built into the application successfully completes the task with 22 or even fewer rotations, solving all sides of the cube thanks to Herbert Kociemba’s two-phase algorithm.",

The development of the system was guided by opinions who has to elaborate data to create reports. The elaboration of data has been, and will continue to be necessary, so I kept it important throughout my software development to keep the project sustainable and functional in the long run with minimal development. I created the system with the information obtained during the research and taking into account the needs and requests of the target user, as the most important thing is that the user community accepts it and is happy to use it. This solid, analytical platform also simplifies the day-to-day tasks of teachers involved in education, but provides a simple, clean, usable interface during the years.

These modern tools have become an integral part of our everyday lives, making tasks such as communication, work, and study much easier. It’s challenging for us to be apart from them, and it’s almost impossible to get along without them. The new genera- tion would struggle if they had to do without these tools since it’s natural for them that all information is available at the click of a button. While this level of technology inte- gration has its advantages, it also brings many disadvantages that we don’t pay enough attention to. In the past decade, education has undergone significant changes due to technolog- ical innovations. Traditional teaching methods have been replaced by modern, digital approaches, and students have adapted to a different learning environment. The intro- duction of digital teaching materials, online educational platforms, virtual classrooms, and electronic diaries has made the learning process more flexible and interactive. Addi- tionally, it’s important to digitize surveys to provide students with immediate feedback on their performance. My colleague and I designed and implemented an application called LearnIT. This app facilitates independent learning through interactive quiz questions, which is a well- proven teaching method. It offers features such as immediate grading, an overview of answers, and a teacher platform that allows for the introduction of various fields of ex- pertise in addition to programming languages.

        "abstract": "In today’s fast-paced world, individuals and businesses engaged in real estate trans- actions often encounter significant challenges when drafting property sale contracts. The creation of these property sale contracts is an integral part of real estate transactions, in- volving complex legalities and meticulous documentation. There is a pressing need for an intuitive tool that can alleviate these complexities and facilitate the creation of accurate and legally compliant contracts. The aim of my thesis is two-fold. Firstly, I intend to create the basis of an online platform to allow the automatic creation of contracts to facilitate secure property sales. This includes the creation and planification of the necessary software architecture, the creation of an easy to use administration interface, as well as the verbatim generation and filling out of PDF documents using templates created by the administrators. Sec- ondly, I intend to document the various stages (and possibilities) of the final deployment, measured within real-world conditions. The proposed website serves as a comprehensive platform, offering users a friendly interface to generate legally binding contracts tailored to their specific requirements. By eliminating the need for extensive legal knowledge or the assistance of costly attorneys, the time and effort required to create a contract is greatly reduced. Comparatively, governments worldwide have implemented similar software solu- tions to address the challenges associated with property sale contracts. However, these government-backed endeavours are often significantly handicapped by their perceived ob- scurity and their convoluted design choices. This platform aims to provide users with a unique and simplified experience that surpasses existing government initiatives. In the beginning of the thesis we will discuss the various technologies employed to create the proposed software solution. Afterwards, we will describe what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform as part of a Software Requirements Specification. A prospective user interface for the platform will be detailed following the proposal of a potential software architecture and deployment layout. Finally, some measurements will be presented to rationalize the decisions taken during the planning stages of the software architecture.",

With the widespread of the internet the number of these news has grown exponentially thus making it impossible to analyze and research them only with human resources. Today the data mining industry is in an accelerated expansion trough the text ana- lytics and the NLP methods, because these can mine information efficiently and in a fast way from big data, by half-automated methods and with the help of different algorithms. This paper will examine this subject focusing on the Transylvanian Hungarian press. We try to extract as many useful information as possible from the multitude of gathered articleswiththeaidofdifferentlibrariesandsoftware. Basedontheextractedinformation we can make statistical calculations, analyses, e.g. how popular is a person during a certain period, in the Transylvanian Hungarian press? Besides we can create visuals that everyone understands and we get a view of the press “world”. I presented my dissertation in the XXI.

In our accelerating world in a lot of cases we prefer a fast and acceptably optimal solution, rather than a slow but accurate one. This is where the Ant Colony algorithm help a lot of industries, which guarantees a pretty good solution in lots of the cases. The implemented web application helps us in a many areas, because besides the other functionalities, it implements five types of the Ant Colony algorithm, it is capable to visualize them, save the input data, show detailed results and store them. With these tools we can perform measurements on a variety of data sets, with different parameter configurations and different types of algorithms. Based on the data acquired from the realized software, I compare the different types of the Ant Colony algorithm, their advantages and disadvantages in different cases, and furthermore I search an optimal configuration, which calculates a sufficiently optimal result within an acceptable run-time. At last but not least we make conclusion, that in general and for specific input data sets which algorithm is the most promising, so which one of the many types of the Ant Colony algorithm is worth further investigation.",

Since the AlgoRhythmics environment is also used to develop computational thinking, it is not only able to test the information about algorithms, but also to test the development of computational thinking thanks to this module. In previous research, when measuring students’ performance, separate testing appli- cations were used, and to do this, the students who participated in the research had to navigate from the AlgoRhythmics site to another site, register there and then complete a test consisting of different questions. To this end, the idea of an embeddable module was born to improve the user experience and to help teachers to simplify testing within the environment and to make it easier to conduct research. I felt it was important to create a module that was easy to use and that would facilitate the work of teachers using the environment. At the same time, an important criterion was to create a competitive module with all the functionality that was available in the testing interfaces used so far. With the completed module, I was also able to create a research in which I tested the development of computational thinking through metaphors, and this research was the first to be done with this module, within the environment framework.",

        "abstract": "The aim of my thesis is the usage of principal component analysis for the compres- sion of digital image files. Moreover, my thesis compares different methods for reaching the mentioned aim, and experiments with the variation of different constant values for implementing the ideal compression. In the world of the modern internet, the storage and sending of different image files comes with significant storage need and data traffic, and because of that the reduction of image sizes is essential. There is more than one method for image compression, in my thesis I am researching the usage of principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is rooted in statistics. During the process we are searching so called principal components, which are specific to the dataset. After the compression, we are storing only the coefficients of these. The number of principal components can be increased almost arbitrarily, and with that we can optimize the accuracy, “goodness” of the compressed data, although that obviously increases the size of the resulting compressed image data files. Since that goodness value is measurable and comparable, the best method for the compression can be found relatively easily. In my thesis I aim to search the answer for the following questions: what kind of specific characteristics of the images are affecting the goodness of the compression, what kind of changes are observable between different implementations of the principal com- ponent analysis, what kind of effects do these have on the goodness of the image, as well as on the time required for the compression? These results are compared and evaluated. In my thesis I am searching the answer/answers for the posed questions mainly by using already existing implementations. The goodness of the resulting images after the compression is measured by multiple different methods. Finally, we draw the conclusions based on the acquired results.",

The accessibility and usability of websites play a significant role in facilitating efficient information retrieval and knowledge sharing. Therefore, the primary focus of this thesis is to investigate the creation of a website that is user-friendly and intuitive. This website aims to provide extensive rankings of academic journals using the SCimago Journal Rank (SJR) database and its associated metrics. We can edit scientific journals, or more precisely, we can add important information that is not included in the database used, such as the academic year in which it was published, or the title of the scientific article. The search results can be saved as PDF files for con- venient access later on. Furthermore, visitors also have the opportunity to contribute to the website’s database by adding new journals, thereby helping to expand the range of available information. In order to gain access to the data on the website, visitors are requested to register, enabling them to perform searches and contribute new information. The primary objective of this thesis is to present a step-by-step guide to building a website that is easily accessible to users worldwide, ensuring a seamless browsing experi- ence. Throughout this research, I will explore a variety of methodologies and techniques implemented during the development phase, offering insights into the underlying tech- nologies that were utilized. Furthermore, this thesis aims to shed light on the evaluation criteria employed to establish the journal ranking system within the website. By analyz- ing and processing relevant data, the ranking methodology will be delineated, providing users with a reliable and informed basis for their academic endeavors. Next,Iwillproceedtooutlinetheassessmentstandardsemployedintheconstruction ofthewebsite’sknowledgebase,specificallypertainingtotherankingofscientificjournals.

Worldwide there is at least one computer or machine running an operating system in almost every building, as we know. Therefor, care must be taken in order not to be a victim of a virtual attack. After we entered the world of the Internet, there is a growing threat from malware. Therefore, I tried to develop a software-based keylogger from the persppective of an attacker, i.e hacker. However, I was not only interested in the perspective of an attacker, but I also wanted how I can prevent them. So anti-virus programs prevent keyloggers from being installed on systems. During my research, I noticed that keyloggers are also used in companies to monitor their computer systems. During planning, the project had to be divided into two parts. So two softwares had to be designed: one will run on the hacker’s side and monitor the victim’s keystrokes and the other one ill be installed on the victim’s operating system. The victim side sends the data and the hacker side receives it. The data travels over the network, so it is a good idea to encrypt the packets. For example, with well-monitored system packets traveling on the network can be tracked. The purpose of encryption is to prevent anyone from interpeting the content of a package.

It is worth mentioning that one of the most important aspects of cycling is the routes we take. Therefore, the app provides the possibility to save and share these routes with other users. It is not uncommon for people to share pictures of things they are proud of on other social platforms.

Therefore, both of the players resorts to the strategy that results their the gratest benefit. However, there are games, when if one of the players applies their strategy, it also benefits the other, which is obviously unfavorable for the first mentioned player. For this reason, both players must determine the relative frequency of using their available strategies to maximize their chances for the victory. This problem is answered by the Nash equilibrium point, named after the American mathematician, John Forbes Nash. In two-person games, that set of strategy in which neither of the players can increase their profit by changing their strategy, in case of their opponent doesn’t change their strategy, is called Nash equilibrium point. In my thesis the main purpose is to determine the equilibrium point mentioned above, mathematically and also in programming point of view, using the prisoner’s dilemma problem. Besides that I will cover the following topics as well: the introduction of basic concepts of game theory, the prisoner’s dilemma, the presentation of applied algorithm and the interpretation of the result. To compute this equilibrium point I apply the Lemke-Howson algorithm. For the visualization of obtained equilibrium point I use Python as programming language. Also belong to the goals to introduce the reader to the world of game theory and to help users with average mathematical and information technology skill to understand the Nash equilibrium.",

In real life, many people struggle with time management problems, both at work and in their personal lives. Constant procrastination at work, difficulties in dealing with unexpected situations or delays due to dependencies during group work. In such cases we tend to spend more time on solving a problem rather than involving other points of view or more experienced people. Unfortunately, it is not possible to come up with a universal template to solve all these types of problems, but in many cases we end up making the same mistake over and over again. In general, the trinity of orderliness, good scheduling and good communication is the key to solving the problems mentioned above. Within the scope of this project, a user-friendly and efficient android application will be implemented that will help to organize tasks, measure work performance and collaborate with colleagues within a work team. By measuring the time spent on tasks in a specific way, the application is able to set up a profile that speeds up the process of unblocking tasks by giving users the possibility to perform a targeted search to find the person best suited to perform the task. A platform that puts more emphasis than its predecessors on maintaining focus and the well-being of users at work. The implemented application allows logged-in users to create categories, projects and tasks within a secure system, time them and generate and view reports. The aim is primarily to assist the user’s work, not to monitor it. Their skills are also measured during the timekeeping process so that the accumulated experience is quantified to some extent. This gives credit to the accumulated experience base that the user has gathered during his measured work. In addition, the pomodoro technique has been introduced for time measurement, which also contributes to the user’s productivity.",

As we know, almost every living thing in the world around us can be traced to Darwin’s theory of evolution. A similar computer program can be processed for this process, resulting in the production of different \"individuals\" as genetic processes. There are situations in life where it is important to get the best results not only ac- curately but also quickly. In these cases, it can be very important which of the algorithms available to you to choose to solve the problem. The focus of my case study is the problem of graph coloring, which is still a very unknown field in the programming world. For my research, I am looking for an answer to the question of how worthwhile it is to use genetic algorithms to got a better solution than a given one. In the meantime, I have listed several aspects for my proof. Such as what is the difference between a classical solution and a genetic solution for a given task, or what happens if the initial population is less than the number of generations we will get is the result or vice versa, or what if I increase or decrease the number of colors or what will have an effect on the effectiveness of a good coloring, the number of edges or nodes. I run the survey on a self-designed software for 100 randomly generated graphs. The tests are repeated and I calculated averages to make the results even more valid. Finally I compared and evaluated the results. By the end of my research, based on the results, we draw conclusions as to why it is suitable to use a genetic algorithm. We can also delve into the problem of graph coloring.",

This form of online learning is becoming increasingly popular, resulting in a growing number of such courses available on the market, which makes it increasingly difficult to choose the ones that are truly relevant for us. Online courses are available from an increasing number of providers. However, in order to find the ideal one for us, we have to explore multiple learning platforms, which can be a time-consuming task. In this case, it is important to be able to find the most suitablecoursefromasmanysourcesaspossibleintheshortestpossibletime,particularly on a specific topic. In my thesis, I aim to present a software that can facilitate this course search process. The main purpose of developing the software is to allow individuals who want to learn to see the courses in one place, combining various courses from the mentioned learning platforms. Additionally, it is important that the software’s users are able to save these courses and track their progress. During the design and development process, I have also taken into account the ex- periences of other similar applications in order to provide new and innovative features to users. The thesis will provide a detailed presentation of the application’s structure, the technologies used, and the access and processing of the courses. Finally, the completed software will be presented, demonstrating in practice how previously identified problems were solved and what functionalities the software enables.",

        "abstract": "In information systems, the access to services are mostly based on authentication to protect the system and user information. In authentication systems, we distinguish two main types: entry-based and continuous authentication systems. Based on the reliability of the authentication system both types can be divided into primary and secondary methods. In my research, I examine a secondary authentication system based on behavioral biometrics: authentication based on PIN-code typing dynamics. This system assumes primarily the knowledge of the PIN-code while secondarily it checks its typing rhythm. The typing rhythm as a behavioral biometrics is a long-researched area, however very few researches have been conducted in connection to PIN-code typing rhythms. Initially, such systems used 4 digit-PIN codes for authentication, today the use of 6 digit PIN-codes is getting popular. In the first part of my research, I created a data collector application that collects the typing information from the users with the help of a software keyboard. With the help of the software, we collected 20 typing samples of 6 digit PIN-codes from 112 people. I tried several anomaly detectors, but the best results were provided by the scaled Manhattan detector: 0.126 equal error rate (EER) and 0.925 area under the curve (AUC). In the second part of my research, I incorporated the developed method into an An- droid software component that any application running on Android phone can simply use by specifying dependencies. Both the data collector and the Android software component source codes are publicly available on GitHub.",

Nowadays, more people have their own car and this number is growing more and more. The problem is that more people ignore the traffic signs that can be found on the road sections. Drivers with less experience are not intentionally but ignore it, or rather the more professional drivers are not deliberately paying attention sometimes. This is where my Traffic Signs app comes in, which is currently specialized in traffic signs. The app is also useful not only for novice but for more experienced drivers because it is informative, new different things can be learned from certain traffic signs in the territory of Romania. In additon, it has a live monitoring feature that monitors the traffic signs in real time, identifies them, and informs the user. Careful driving is greatly facilitated by routine and focus, but in the absence of these, a more modern motor vehicle can be a great help because informs the driver about warnings, marks and calls on the route in question. The majority of modern vehicles already have a smart system that informs the vehicle driver about different road factors and dangers. But not everyone can afford to buy modern cars for financial reasons. So all we have to do is in- stall the app on a phone with an Android system and a camera, start the app and put it be- hind the windshield in a position with clear vision for the phone. The purpose of the applica- tion is to identify the dangers on the road, to notify the traffic signs on the side of the road, a stop sign that has not been detected can be a big risk at times. Finally, there are several benefits to this app, which improves the driver’s ability to mon- itor by constantly informing us about the traffic signs that have been ignored. Making this driver aware of his own careless. It keeps track of the signs he has ever seen, which we can show to the police or other driver, as appropriate.",

Instead of spending hours in the library extracting information out of books, we can now download a note from the Internet, which contains all the information we need. This facilitated information acquisition made learning more optimal for the people, as they can access more information in less time. To this end, I have prepared my dissertation, which provides access to important, informative notes, uploaded by users, for users through a website. Every note can be linked to a subject, making the search easier. When uploading, the user needs to enter the major and subject of the note, in addition, a descriptive name, and last but not least the note itself has to be uploaded. Then with one click, the user can upload the note to the database, after which it will be displayed on the main page of the web application. These notes also have a rating, which lets the users rate each others notes, helping to filter out bad/weak notes. After listing, users have the option to download and view the notes. Every user can list their own notes on a separate page, where they have the option to delete the note.",

There are many places where you can find similar apps for cyclists, so BicyHub is not entirely new; you could say that BicyHub did not reinvent the wheel. However, what makes it stand out from its peers is that it combines the greater functionality of more familiar applications in one place. The app in question is a React Native-based cross-platform phone app. The goal was to design and build a comprehensive app that meets almost every need of cyclists, helping them in as many ways as possible. The main feature of the app is the ability to keep a record of cyclist data and its traceability within the platform, including the description, value, history, and previous owners of their bikes. The service log plays an important role, as it provides accurate data about the bike, including minor and major operations and costs. A great advantage, in addition to these features, is the service record, which can include specialist services or just individuals who can carry out minor work at home. This feature shows the current location on a map, the owner, and the evaluation. Keeping an account of these operations provides cyclists with a quick and efficient way to keep their equipment up to date and in order. All of this is shaped by community opinion through various opinion-forming tools.",

At the same time its second goal is to help the improvement and the algorithmic thinking of the students, whom are passing the difficulty levels of the occurring exercises and to deepen their competence. In the XXI. century a student, who is a beginner software engineer, is faced with the fact, that if he wants to learn the basics of software engineering in an autodidact way and needs to decide, which programming language to choose the first thing that needs to be done is looking for those websites, which can help them in a theoretic and practical way. In most cases, if you want to reach these sites in Hungarian, you will not really get any results. This is also sustained by the evaluation of the answers to the pre-test questions, which confirmed my decision: it may be useful to create a platform that can ensure the verification and correctness of a code written in several programming languages. An added benefit of this platform may be that the requirements of the tasks are formulated in Hungarian. As the saying goes, “even Rome was not built in a day” so the Kóditt platform is set off on the road to the final destination with small steps. Currently, the Kóditt platform seeks to guide students from simple tasks to complex ones using the C ++ programming language. The use foreign languages on these kinds of platforms takes me back to my high school memories, reminding me of the many difficulties I had to deal with when I came across the phrasing of the tasks of software engineering and math in a foreign language. Kóditt thus provides a solution for Hungarian students to learn the basics of software engineeringbypracticingbasictasksthatareautomaticallycorrectedbytheimplemented software.",

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a partially developed standard that covers an API that makes it possible to manage the graphics card and program two- and three- dimensional graphics through a simple, standard interface. OpenGL is a tool that pro- grammers enjoy using because it allows almost direct control of the graphics card, three- dimensional shapes can be easily drawn, and the rendering method can be controlled. In today’s world, people are increasingly visual, their attention is drawn to what pleases the eye, what is interesting, exciting, new, modern. We all want to gather new experiences, enrich ourselves with new experiences and use modern technology. That’s exactly why I chose OpenGL, because I wanted to implement an application that would give children a fun opportunity to assess their knowledge of the Bible. In addition to deepening knowledge, an important goal was to provide children with a play experience. Since children are very visual, we have found virtual reality to be the most ideal way to capture the interest of 7-12 year olds and deepen and expand their Bible knowledge. OpenGL gave me a simple, nice and quickly implementable help to achieve my goal. In this dissertation, I will briefly introduce the Unity programming platform, the Google Cardboard virtual reality program, and the application I created.",

The 2020-2021 school year has made a difference in everyone’s lives. COVID-19 has changed the way we live our lives. Authorities were forced to introduce decisions that limited our daily lives. Restrictions have also been introduced in the field of education, which is why face-to-face education has been replaced by an online educational environment. However, this has been to the detriment of the academic development of many students. This period has proved that online education is still in its infancy, so there is a great need to improve it. This should also be an important goal for the future, as we may need it again at any time as a result of unforeseen events. At the same time, online learning has existed in a sense so far and has been favorably used by students. By this I mean the independent development of the learner by using different phone and web applications to better understand the curriculum. So the question would be: if there are online applications that help to acquire and deepen new knowledge, what could be the real role of the teacher in teaching? Also, how could the benefits of a teacher’s presence be assessed? To be able to assess the possibilities, I thought programming teaching would be a subject that was closer to me and could provide a solution to that. Among programming techniques, my research is limited to examining the teaching of graph algorithms. The practical part of my dissertation was the implementation of a web application that en- ables students to learn and develop independently by acquiring theoretical and practical knowledge, as well as providing opportunities for teacher-led learning. At the same time, the site offers an opportunity to evaluate the development of knowledge that the teacher’s presence will bring to students. In order to test the application and to search for answers, I conducted surveys among the first-year students of the university majoring in informatics and computer science, with a total of four groups. I also tested the effectiveness of the application and the im- portance of the role of the teacher. I also processed the results statistically and visualized them using diagrams that provided answers to the questions mentioned above.",

First one being, the unused items that are lying in our houses without any purpose. The shops that sold those items can not take them back, so they can be somehow reused by other people. The other problem being the lack of people in construction, the craftsman.

The dataset used consists of 3264 MRI im- ages, which are part of the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challange, and which have been preprocessed to improve the quality and consistency of the neural network input data. I designed and implemented my own model architecture using TensorFlow, with a focus on efficiency and accuracy. To improve model performance and generalization, I ap- plied various pre-processing techniques, including normalization, zero-centering and data rescaling. The CNN model was trained and validated on the dataset, and the hyperpa- rameters were tuned to optimize performance and as a function of the results. One of the main strengths of my model is that it is small. The final parameter number is 5897380. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, I analysed the results using a number of metrics, including accuracy, loss functions, ROC-AUC values, F1-score and confusion matrix. These analyses helped me to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model in classifying different tumour types and how to optimise the parameters. The final model has achieved promising results, demonstrating its potential to help healthcare professionals in the accurate classification of brain tumours. The overall accuracy obtained with the model in a 5-layer cross-validation is 0.9512% for the 4-class classification problem and 0.9666% for the 3-class classification problem (excluding the tumor-free images) on test data that the model has never seen, i.e., that have not been in either the training or validation phase. This result highlights the im- portance of advanced machine learning techniques in medical image analysis and the potential of CNNs in improving the diagnostic accuracy of brain tumor classification.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, various quiz applications are becoming more and more widespread on the Internet. A quiz is a series of questions on a specific topic and form that people should try to answer correctly. This is followed by the result and score, that shows a comprehensive picture of the knowledge in the given topic. However, there are few applications whose main purpose is to transfer information and deepen knowledge. In many cases, the only way to take part in quizzes is to join other activities. In addition, most of the topics are not well separated or precisely defined. Furthermore, it is a common confounding factor that the correct answers are not shown, and if the questions that appear during the quiz are always the same, in the same order. In my thesis, a quiz-focused software was implemented which provides a solution to the problems described. It matters a lot for people who would often and willingly take quizzes to do so in a friendly, unified, and simple interface where the community they create will help and support each other. To implement the interface, I created a web application with basic features that are useful, clear and easy to manage. In the implemented application, users can not only try out existing quizzes which assess knowledge, but also expand this list by making new quizzes on their own topic. It often happens that a quiz with the preferred theme is not found anywhere. In this case, using the \"Requests\" feature will allow people to request a quiz on the topic they want and the other users can accomplish it in the near future. After finishing a quiz, it is possible to view our results in more detail in a PDF document, which will help us to memorize new information. Members can communicate with each other in many ways (forum, chat, private message), make friends, and see the opinions and the results of the quizzes.",

        "abstract": "The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be in- terpreted together with their context. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other, in in other words, they need a so-called normalization. The most popular histogram nor- malization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al in 2000, which aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternately, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform, and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with them. This thesis proposes to inves- tigate, which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques, and which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two publicly available brain MRI data sets are involved in the investigation, one without and the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation, we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more than five milestone that represent constraints of the normalized histogram.",

The first Rubik’s Cube was made in the year 1974 by Rubik Ernő, who was a Hungarian architect, sculptor and game designer. Since its inception, it became popular worldwide, it entertains millions of people every day. Solving the Rubik’s Cube demands attention, patients and strategic thinking of its user, but thanks to improvements of modern technology, the way of thinking needed to solve the cube is a lot easier to learn. Thanks to the improvements of our smart devices and automated robots, solving the Rubik’s Cube reached new levels. These days Rubik’s Cube solver application are available on personal computers, and also on smart phones, making the learning of new solving algorithms a lot easier. Usually an application like this show a 3D representation of a Rubik’s Cube on the screen of the device, which can be rotated by the user using fingers or a mouse. The applications then calculate an optimal solution, and shows it to the user. The user can copy these steps on his own cube, this way he can devolop his own skills. Usually its a plus, if the application is not only able to show an optimal solution, but also can show given solving algorithms, this way helping the user understand the cube more. My software is able to read in a real cube, using the camera of a smart device, this way speeding up the process of inputting the state of the cube into the application. After the scanning of the cube is done, the user can ask for an optimal solution, of which he can go through step by step, or if he feels like it, he can try to solve the cube himself. Aside from this, i wanted to implement a feature, where the user can learn given solving algorithms. For this reason exists a separate menu, where the user can choose a solving algorithm, and can see its steps on the cube. The application was made in Unity, using C#, and for finding an optimal solution i used Kociemba’s two step solving algorithm. This algorithm is well liked for its speed and low solution step count.",

The idea of running a business has become more normalised, it no longer seems that only someone of the calibre of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates can run a company, so more and more young people are trying and more new businesses are being born. However, the optimal functioning of a modern business requires the right tools to help monitor certain behaviours, create a successful client-provider communication interface, help manage the resources of the business, or even shorten the time taken up by paperwork. The aim of my thesis is to find a simple, fast and attractive solution for the latter of these, more specifically for the generation and storage of tax invoices. The application I have created aims to be a guaranteed solution for businesses and entrepreneurs that sell services or products and need to generate invoice statements. The application can be made highly accessible thanks to its web-based format. I have created an easy-to-use schema for editing and saving invoices. The application also leaves room for users who do not wish to log in, but for users with an account, it provides an archive that helps not only to visualise the already created invoices, but also to highlight them statistically. The interface data is stored in a MongoDB database, which is managed by a Node.js based REST API using Express.js and Mongoose libraries - I would call this the backend oftheproject.

The musical taste of a person reveals a lot about their personality. Furthermore, if we know somebody’s musical taste it is easier to start a conversation which is useful in the early stages of a friendship. Such an application, together with get to know you games, is a very good icebreaker, because it can be funny to get to know somebody through music. In addition, we can get acquainted with musical genres or songs previously unknown to us. The online interface enables us to play even when we are not in the same location. We can get closer to our colleagues during online classes or online work",

        "abstract": "This dissertation focuses on the design and implementation of AniMathIO, a user- friendlymathematicalanimationsoftware. Theprimaryobjectivewastocreateatoolthat simplifies the creation of mathematical animations, making it accessible to educators and students with minimal technical expertise. In the context of mathematics education, visual representation of the material being taught is increasingly important. Interactive content, particularly videos and animations, are effective tools for enhancing the learning experience and performance. Studies have shown that interactive videos significantly improve quiz results and overall student sat- isfaction. Another study highlighted that the structure and timing of interactive video content can impact procedural learning processes, while a South Korean study indicated that video viewing strategies can reduce cognitive load unrelated to learning, thereby enhancing learning performance. Despite their benefits, creating these videos and animations can be challenging, often requiring hours of video editing using specialized and expensive software like Adobe After Effects,SonyVegas,FinalCutPro,DavinciResolve,andAdobePremierePro. Thesetools are often complex and not user-friendly for beginners, and they are typically platform- specific, limiting accessibility. To address these challenges, AniMathIO was conceptualized as a solution specifically designed for mathematics education. The software is intended to be straightforward and easy to use, enabling anyone interested in teaching mathematics, even those with minimal technical skills, to create useful mathematical visualizations and explanations. Initially, the software was based on the Manim Python library created by Grant Sanderson, known for his 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel. While Manim is a highly professional and free tool for creating mathematical animations, it requires Python programming knowledge, which can be a barrier for many users. AniMathIO was developed using modern web technologies, including TypeScript, Nextron, React, and several animation libraries. The software’s architecture was designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features. Key features include a timeline-based editing interface, support for various mathematical objects such as points, lines, vectors, and functions, and export capabilities in multiple formats. The development process was thoroughly documented, and a promotional website was created to showcase the software’s capabilities. The final product offers a powerful yet simple solution for creating high-quality mathematical visualizations, addressing a gap in the existing software landscape. AniMathIO also aims to be platform-independent, providing a desktop application that can be used on various operating systems. This ensures broader accessibility and usability. The software combines the ease of traditional video editing software with the specific needs of mathematical visualization, making it a unique tool in the field of math- ematics education. The ultimate goal is to support the teaching of mathematics by pro- viding an intuitive, accessible tool for creating educational animations and videos.",

In my research, I examine the human-like behavior of bots in terms of different gener- ated mouse movements. I generated synthetic data sets based on different parameterized versions of Bézier curves and also by a generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) spe- cialized in time series. I performed feature extraction on raw data sets, which resulted in a total of 29 features. I had access to the Sapimouse data set, which contains mouse dynamics data for 120 users. Using this data set and the synthetic data sets, I measured the performance of different detectors. The best performing detector, which proved to be the most suc- cessful in distinguishing between generated and real human mouse movements was the LOF, achieving values above 0.81 for 1 mouse movement and above 0.96 for 10 mouse movements in terms of AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) metric. The research part was followed by the development of a software that illustrates single mouse movement-based bot detection.",

Collaboration, communication and visuality have become such essential aspects that they are also widely used in the management of software projects. The application of Kanban methodology has become paramount over time and current platforms have evolved to combine this methodological tool with other agile project management philosophies, resulting in an application with a variety of functionalities. The primary goal of our thesis is to successfully implement the Kanban methodology within the application, using solutions that provide us with interesting challenges and contribute to the enhancement of our programming skills. Also, we wanted to create an application that would help small groups of people to manage tasks in specific projects. We have tried to provide our visual interface with functionalities that have proven to be indispensable after numerous scientific articles and research. The introduction of the Kanban methodology in our application is of paramount importance as it allows visual tracking of workflows, thus increasing the efficiency and structure of teams. By providing a user-friendly application that supports project man- agement for small teams, we facilitate transparent task management and effective collab- oration. The aim of our research and development was to create a tool that contributes to the development of modern project management solutions from both a practical and theoretical point of view.",

        "abstract": "The main drawback of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the lack of a standard intensity scale. All observed numerical values are relative and can only be in- terpreted together with their context. Before feeding MRI data volumes to supervised learning segmentation procedures, their histograms need to be registered to each other, in in other words, they need a so-called normalization. The most popular histogram nor- malization technique used to assist brain MRI segmentation is the algorithm proposed by Nyúl et al in 2000, which aligns the histograms of a batch of MRI volumes without paying attention to possible focal lesions that might distort the histogram. Alternately, some recent works applied histogram normalization based on a simple linear transform, and reported achieving slightly better accuracy with them. This thesis proposes to inves- tigate, which of the commonly used histogram normalization methods provides the most suitable preprocessed brain MRI data for accurate segmentation via machine learning techniques, and which parameter settings are likely to assure high quality results. Two publicly available brain MRI data sets are involved in the investigation, one without and the other with focal lesions. Based on the results obtained via experimental evaluation, we recommend using the histogram normalization method of Nyúl et al., with no more than five milestone that represent constraints of the normalized histogram.",

Mobile Device Management is a software made to standard- ize and simplify the use of mobile devices. The aim of MDM is a client-server architecture which enhances security, and removes complexities from the user’s tasks. Its most impor- tant role is enforce different policies, such as banning or restricting different applications or websites, for which a multitude of different technologies exist. We can analyze an MDM system by a number of parameters. It is crucial for the application to be reliable and be well-maintained. It is a priority to run fast and be effi- cient, so the user will not be bothered during important tasks. One of the most significant expectation of the users is security and the discreet handling of private data. Last but not least, it is important for the user to have choices based on personal needs and economic situation. The aim of my current thesis is to map the currently most popular MDM options on the market, compare their capabilities, as well as use the identified data to diagnose user requirements and expectations. Beyond the market analysis, it is part of the goal to develop my own starter pack. The starter pack I develop is a simple and easy to expand basic application, which can be used as a basis for more robust products. It is made of a simple web API and a mobile application.

Today, many people use the Spotify music listening platform, with some people listening to more than 8 hours of music per day. Many people, including myself, got bored of international and national charts and wanted to find new music, but Spotify was not very helpful. That’s why I created a web app that allows Spotify users to get personalised music recommendations, analyse their listening habits and data, and get detailed statistics on their favourite tracks, artists and genres. The web application is called \"Datafy\", which is a combination of data and Spotify. I chose this name because it mostly reflects how the web app processes Spotify data. Before developing this project, I looked at similar web applications and re- alised that most of them lacked a personalised music recommendation system, so my primary goal was to implement music recommendation properly, and also to visually display the user’s Spotify statistics.",

This makes it easier for users to find content that matches their interests and discover new things. My thesis presents a website with images by category. I have chosen to do this because I find the role of images on this type of website extremely important in attracting attention. Images are attractive and quickly attract the attention of users. Therefore, a content recommendation system full of images is an excellent opportunity to capture the interest of users in an entertaining way. My content recommendation is implemented by measuring the time spent on images. measuring time spent on images can help to increase the effectiveness of content recom- mendation. If users spend more time looking at or exploring images, it may indicate that the content is interesting or attractive to them. This information allows the system to draw conclusions about users preferences and tastes. For example, if someone looks at sports photos for a longer period of time, it may indicate that they are interested in this type of content. Based on this, the system can recommend further similar content, which is more likely to attract teh interest.",

        "abstract": "In the realm of competitive sports, it is not uncommon for individuals who follow a contest from the sidelines to immerse themselves in the world of competition to such a degree, that they passionately cheer for a favorite side or even place bets on certain competitors. The competitive curiosity of humans can manifest in various ways, ranging from the frenzy of cheering alongside numerous other fans at a live match to everyday conversations with friends at a bar on who will win today’s big game. Building upon this idea, I have developed a computer application that offers two important possibilities for users to solve dilemmas that arise in the realm of basketball championships: a system for importing and recording team and player performances, which enables us to create complex and advanced insights not only into an athlete’s personal statistics, but also to compare them with those of another party, and a championship creation program where we can form teams led by others, engage in matches with them, and maintain rankings based on those matches. To implement this system, I have developed a . Net MAUI program based on the C# language. It utilizes a MySQL-based phpMyAdmin database system to store and retrieve data for teams, players, and their statistics. Additionally, through an API, there is a possibility to fetch statistics of real NBA players and teams for different seasons, which will be used to create multi-layered metric measurements. My application can be divided into three distinctive menu sections. The first one is the league creator, where users can employ personally created clubs in various matches. Within this section, they can assign statistics and final results to players associated with the teams, and also rank the teams and players based on different criterias. The second section is the team and player creator, where users can create teams, customize them, and also retrieve and store the seasonal performances of real teams and players in the database. The third section, which is also a crucial one, is the comparation and evaluation section, where imported teams and players can be evaluated and compared using different convoluted metrics and graphs based on the imported information based on their performance.

In recent years, online shopping has gained a significant advantage over in-person shopping with physical contact. To achieve this, there are numerous options available to interested indi- viduals, ranging from online stores published on websites to ordering via phone calls and specifically developed mobile applications. Taking these aspects into account, I have chosen a theme for my project that aligns with current trends while also incorporating innovative technologies to enhance the user experience. My project implements an online furniture store within an Android applica- tion. The app provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for both the seller, who fulfills the role of an administrator, and the buyer, who acts as a user. From a design perspective, the user interface is clean, easily understandable, and manageable for everyone, while also offering all the necessary functions for a seamless shopping experience. Users can create their own accounts, allowing them to browse the application at their leisure, favorite products for future reference, and complete the pur- chase process. Perhaps the only drawback of online shopping is the difficulty in physically observing the products due to the absence of physical presence. While physical shopping allows us to use all our senses to select and examine items from every angle, touch them, and rotate them, online shops generally do not offer solutions to these issues. In my project, I have endeavored to overcome this drawback by implementing a virtual room feature that allows buyers to not only view images and read descriptions of desiredproductsbutalsoobservethemin3D,rotatethem,andplacethemproportionally within a room.

In my thesis I seek answers to the question that which parameters could achieve the most accurate image segmentation on a given dataset. The accurate image segmentation might help in all sorts of fields and could potentially save lives, for instance, on a CT scan, if it can detect and identify an abnormality of a tissue. During the research, we save models with different kind of parameters to compare and evaluate the differences between these models. The examined architecture with the best parameter settings results at least 97% classification accuracy and it is able to detect parts of the images, so the model provides some really good results. Since U-net is a new approach to image segmentation, it may be worthwhile to try several parameter settings that could lead to an even more accurate image segmentation architecture.",

The purpose of these applications is to reduce preparation time, to make the work of organisers easier and also to allow those who want to participate on an event to easily communicate their intention to do so, to be able to choose among the many events displayed and to find out details about them. The project aims to develop software facilitating the organisation of Open days at the university. In addition, it will be possible not only to collect applications, but also to summarise them and visualise the data received according to various criteria. The implemented software allows connected users to view the events taking place during open days, their dates, locations and organisers, as well as to register and un- subscribe from them. For administrator users, it is possible to add events, together with relevant details, as well as edit and delete them.",

The topic of my thesis is the display and visualization of large image collections in various layouts. The size of the image collections I used exceeds forty thousand images, but the theoretical upper limit surpasses this by far. I have developed an application that can display the images from the opened collec- tion and arrange them based on extracted metadata, all within seconds. My application is built on a client-server architecture. The server is written in the Rust[rus23]programminglanguageusingtheAxumframework. Theclient,runninginthe browser, is built in TypeScript[typ23] and consists of two main parts. The desired layout can be selected through a user interface created with the React[rea23] framework, and this code is also responsible for the settings of the selected layout. The part responsible for image display does not use a framework but follows a custom-designed architecture. The WebGL[web23] library is used for rendering the images. The application has gone through several development cycles. I will now present the design decisions necessary for displaying image collections of this size and support them with measurements. Furthermore, I will showcase the layouts generated by the application for the collec- tion I used.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is the presentation of a web application that makes it easier to manage the days off of employees within a company. In a larger company, as the number of employees increases, it becomes more and more difficult for the management to handle the allocation of days off. At the same time, employees also face difficulties in the application process, which is not the same for all workplaces and may even vary from time to time within a company. The application aims to overcome these problems. To achieve this goal, I decided to create a web application. One of the main aspects of the application is to make everyone’s job easier, so it should also be easy to access, without having to go through the installation process on each device separately. At the same time, the development does not have to take into account the specific requirements of different operating systems. All you need is a device that can connect to the Internet and has a browser. In this thesis I will describe the architecture of the application, how it works and the technologies used to implement it. I will describe the frameworks used, their characteris- tics and how they have contributed to the implementation of my application. Technologyhasbeenapartofoureverydaylifeforquitesometimenow,hencesimilar applications already exist. Therefore, I think it is important to mention and compare my own application with these and highlight why my application is more suitable for a company. Finally, I will summarise the features implemented in the application and the oppor- tunities they offer. In addition, I consider it important to set goals for the future so that the application can meet the expectations that will arise in the meantime and, by adding further features, make the work of the company and its employees even easier.",

Theeducationsystemhadtogothrough enormous changes in order to be able to pass on the right level and quality of knowledge to future generations. In my dissertation I tried to find a solution to such a problem. The source of the problem is not new, it has been felt so far in the teaching of Hungarian language pro- gramming. Students usually do not receive adequate feedback on the tasks they have prepared and submitted, only a certain score, depending on the correctness of the solved tasks. Furthermore, so far there has been no online collection of tasks in Hungarian that provides help to those who do not have adequate foreign language skills. This is how I came up with the idea to create a web-based application that is easy to access and use for anyone with internet access. The system is simple yet efficient, with many expansion options, and can be easily adapted to the needs of teachers and students. Bothstudentsandteacherscanregisterfortheapp. Eachstudentcanjoinaclass created by their teacher and then complete dozens of assignments created or uploaded by either their own teacher or other teachers.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, a lot of people use smartphones that make everyday life easier. With these tools, we can easily manage our subscriptions, bank accounts and other personal data. Protecting user data is very important. In addition to passwords, patterns, and PIN codes, biometric methods for data protection are becoming more common. Biometric methods are harder to copy, so they provide stronger protection for our data. In addition to the methods used so far (fingerprint, face recognition, voice recog- nition), signature-based authentication is becoming more and more used. Smartphones with large displays allow users’ drawing the signatures with their finger. The aim of my thesis is to investigate online signature-based authentication. I built a convolutional neural network for feature extraction. I built different models using fea- tures extracted and processed from the signatures. I studied the accuracy and resource requirements of these models using the signatures from two publicly available datasets. I fine-tuned the models for maximum accuracy. The goal was to prevent the system from accepting fake signatures and rejecting the original user as few times as possible. To test the models, I created my own Android application, which consists of two parts. From the signatures entered by the user in the enrollment phase, the system builds thetemplate/learnsthefeaturesextractedfromthesignature. Aftertheenrollmentphase, the user has the opportunity to test the models. In the testing phase, the system decides whether an entered signature is original or fake.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is the development of a healthcare mobile application that solves the connection, communication, and data flow between patients and doctors in a way that both patients and doctors can have an efficient, fast, and secure option in their hands. People often find themselves in a situation where they need help quickly, especially with health problems. I found this topic important because I have experienced firsthand the lack of such an app where I can quickly get in touch with a trusted expert. For example, once I got sick and didn’t know where I could go, because I was in a new city. Similar situations happen every day to other people in this context. As we are now in the 21st century, applications like this already exist, but for some reason they are not yet as widespread. Many doctors still manage their diaries and ap- pointments on paper. Similar, well-functioning applications here in Romania are only used by the larger clinics. Furthermore, I have personally experienced that one call is often not enough to get in touch with a doctor; it takes several attempts. Therefore, I felt that this was a real problem, and I wanted to create a solution for it. The application that I created was developed in Flutter, an open-source framework for mobile application development. One of the great advantages of Flutter is that it allows fast and efficient development, as you can develop for multiple platforms (Android and iOS) from a single code base. The backend of the application is built on Firebase, which is a reliable and secure backend solution, providing fast data processing and real- time data management. Using Firebase, you can easily integrate different features such as authentication, database management, and secure storage of user data. But how is my app different? Well, I felt it was important not only to find a better solution for patients, but also to create a useful interface for doctors too. For example, I focused on making it quick and easy to interpret and process patient data. To do this, I even integrated an AI chatbot to assist the doctor and make this process more efficient. In addition, a great way to manage appointments is also provided by this app. In summary, the aim of my thesis is to present an application that can be a safe, fast, and ideal choice for both patients and doctors for the problems mentioned above. The app not only facilitates contact and communication, but can even increase the speed of effective patient care.",

I cannot give a concrete answer to that, perhaps that is just the way people are. There have always been, and still are, a handful of people who put the needs of others before their own, and they are a beacon of hope in the world. The world of information, and yet people are staggeringly uninformed about most things, especially about what surrounds them. Would people be able to put their own interests aside if they had more information about their immediate environment, about the events and people in it? To devote their time, energy and money to a cause that may not boost dopamine levels so intensely at the moment, but which in the end gives them much greater pleasure. Would people be able to connect with each other in a world where everyone, having done what they had to do, just wants to disconnect from society and be left alone? What if this could be changed, and working together as a team could result in a change in their environment, a change in their outlook on life, and even a change in their lives. Would people be able to give back, and not just take and consume what this world has to offer, if we made the possibilities of helping easily available, at the click of a button from them. My work aims to inform, connect and give back through an application which can drew a step closer to a world where people want to change their environment for the better. One thing that I think almost everyone has nowadays is a mobile phone, so I decided to build this project as a mobile app, supported on both android and iOS platforms, but at the same time with a simple and logical code base, supported by a strong server side, which combined tries to solve the problem of unfamiliarity. My object to use our generations new technologies and tools for creating a plat- form that unites people who wants to help therefore through the little changes in their environment even other people can join this movement what I just call ”Stand Up!”.",

The technology sector often finds that exaggerated hype precedes failure, with organisations rushing to adopt promising solutions without fully understanding the basic criteria for success. In developing this application, I have adhered to the definition that effective gamification is about people achieving personal goals, i.e. it is not solely focused on organisational goals. However, this aspect should not discourage us from putting gamification at the service of community purposes, as individual and community perspectives often simply reflect different viewpoints on the same fundamental goal.

The baccalaureate exam results are of paramount importance not only for students and teachers but also for educational institutions alike. These data greatly influence the future possibilities of students, whether it’s about career opportunities or further education, and they also reflect the quality of education in schools. Visualizing these results provides an opportunity for effective evaluation of education since parents and teachers can gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and progress based on the data. This can help improve the learning process and the development of teaching programs. In my thesis, I aimed to provide a user-friendly interface to the target audience, which can efficiently and quickly process the given data set. I felt the need to develop such a system because the current options for reviewing the data are limited, mostly relying on time-consuming and manual processes, which often lead to errors or delays. Additionally, I paid special attention to the quality of the data to ensure its consistency and normalization for future use. The user interface was implemented using the Next.js framework, with the assistance of D3 and the related Recharts data visualization tools for creating visualizations. The server-side application was built with the Nest.js framework, utilizing the Type- Script language, and it is responsible for managing and serving the data. The foundation of the architecture consists of the scraper and cleaning systems. The web scraper was developed in GoLang, which is suitable for the efficient handling and processing of large data sets. For data cleaning and pre-processing, I used the Python language, specifically the Pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation tool. Ad- ditionally, I worked with various other libraries and technologies, which will be discussed in more detail later on. The main goal in selecting the aforementioned technologies was not only to enable easy and fast access to the data, more accurate inference drawing, and better understand- ing of the result for everyone but also to ensure that the system is future-proof and allows further development.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of digitalisation, the use of mobile devices has become a key enabler for today’s young people, and there is a growing demand for interactive learning tools. The aim of my thesis is to present a quiz-based learning application that we have developed, which tries to put the time spent on the phone to good use. The main goal of the LearnIT application is to learn concepts related to different programming languages through interactive elements. Particular attention is paid to in- teractive quizzes that allow users to actively participate in the learning process. The application also has a teaching interface that allows the creation of new courses and questions. This allows teachers to personalise the course material and adapt it to the needs of the students, making learning even more effective. After the implementation of the application, I was able to carry out an experiment consisting of two parts: a test of the application I developed and a follow-up survey. The testing of the application was carried out in a real environment among the students of the Faculty of Târgu Mures Faculty of Sapientia University of Transylvania. Using the application, the participants filled in different quizzes for several weeks in parallel with the educational material, and their answers were recorded using a scoring system defined by me. After testing, I processed a total of 25 students’ responses, almost 750 answers. The answers and scores thus collected were examined. In contrast, the poll was designed to collect the subjective opinions of the participants. In this case, a total of 51 responses were processed. The results show that users have had a positive experience, as reflected in the data and scores collected during the use of the application, as well as in the opinions expressed in the questionnaire.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized messaging and data sharing have emerged as promising approaches to address the challenges and limitations of centralized systems in the digital era. This paper explores the concept of decentralization in the context of messaging and data sharing, highlighting its advantages and potential implications. The traditional approach to messaging and data sharing relies heavily on centralized platforms, where users’ information is stored and controlled by a single entity. However, thiscentralizedmodelhasinherentlimitations,includingprivacyconcerns,databreaches, censorship, and dependency on a single point of failure. These issues have led to growing interest in decentralized alternatives. Decentralized messaging systems utilize peer-to-peer networks and distributed pro- tocols to enable direct communication between users, eliminating the need for intermedi- aries. This approach ensures greater privacy, as users have more control over their data and can communicate directly without relying on a central server. Additionally, decen- tralized messaging systems can resist censorship attempts, as there is no central authority to regulate or control the flow of information. Similarly, decentralized data sharing aims to democratize the access and control of data. By leveraging blockchain technology and distributed storage systems, users can se- curely share and store data without relying on centralized entities. This enables greater transparency, data integrity, and resilience against attacks or data loss. Moreover, de- centralized data sharing incentivizes collaboration and innovation, as participants can contribute and access data in a trustless and permissionless environment. While decentralized messaging and data sharing offer numerous benefits, they also present challenges. The scalability of decentralized systems, the verification of data au- thenticity, and the incentivization of participants are among the key areas that require further research and development. Additionally, legal and regulatory frameworks need to adapt to accommodate the decentralized nature of these systems, ensuring both privacy protection and accountability. The aim of this thesis is to present an application based on a decentralised system and to introduce the reader to the technologies needed to build it.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is to create an application for smartphones based on OpenGL (Open Graphics Library). OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform application pro- gramming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering. OpenGL occurs in many places, as it is a popular tool for programmers, as they can easily draw three-dimensional shapes and control how they are drawn. Personally, I was also caught up by OpenGL because I wanted to implement an app that develops kids’ math skills so that it would be a memorable experience for them. Knowing these, I came to the conclusion that I would use virtual reality to create a game that would develop the math skills of the first and second graders. In today’s world, there is a strong emphasis on modernization to make a certain thing as simple, enjoyable, and fast as possible. In this thesis, I will briefly present the Unity programming platform, the google cardboard virtual reality program, and the application I created. During the creation of the application, I encountered some errors, I will explain to you when and where I encountered those errors and finally how to eliminate those them.",

We can perform more effectively if we have concrete goals and their corresponding specifications and priorities. There are two types of users in the project, mentor and mentee, who are connected in an Android mobile application. The application allows mentors to create tasks for a user after logging in. In addition, mentors have the option to add new members to the group. And the mentees are informed about the activities related to them after logging into the application. Just like the mentors, to mentees also have the opportunity to modify and view the tasks. The goal of the project is not for the mentor to be able to monitor the mentee, but only guidance is the main guiding principle. The developed application enables users to display and modify their own personal data. All this in order to establish more connections between the mentor and the mentee, thus facilitating more efficient work.",

Usually, it doesnot causeanycomplaints,butsometimesthedeformation results inexcruciatingand musculoskeletal diseases, making timely treatment of flatfoot very important. However, this is often difficult because children need to be very attentive and motivated for regular exercises to be performed correctly and well. Besides, in most cases, there is no possibility for a specialist to control the therapy, which can lead to neglect of treatment. HIMO (Health In Motion) is a cross-platform Flutter application that offers an innovative solution for adults and children with flatfoot. Through it, users can perform therapeutic treatment in the comfort of their homes. Instead of professional supervision, the application provides monitoring of the exercises in real time and guarantees exercise correctness by giving feedback. The treatment is supervised through the calibration of the application by the user, with the help of a colored sock. This enables detecting and framing the foot during therapy. Various therapies are offered, and users also have the option to make their personalized therapy plans. The user interface is easy to understand. Guides and descriptions help ensure the correct handling of the application. Interactions with the user facilitate the smooth ex- ecution of the therapy. Thus, the HIMO application ensures effective and convenient treatment of flatfoot, promoting faster recovery and long-term health preservation while saving time and money.",

        "abstract": "Games with incomplete information cause difficulties for both humans and AI, be- cause they lack essential information that greatly influences the output of the game. In some cases, these games can be transformed into Bayesian games. These games greatly facilitate the development of logical thinking, as well as strategy thinking and decision making, by encouraging individuals to consider options. For artificial intelligence, games with incomplete information are more challenging than games with complete information, as the lack of data makes it more difficult to develop the applicable strategy, due to the high uncertainty that is difficult to model, as the search space is complex. This also means that it is more difficult to approximate the behaviour of the opponent only after a sufficient amount of learning. For this reason, it requires more computational power, since it has to study several different cases to be able to compete against several different opponents. Forthesereasons,Liar’sDiceishardertoteachtoanAI,sinceneithertheopponent’s move nor the game’s currents can be fully known, only roughly determined, but as the game becomes more complex, this becomes an even more demanding process for both human and machine players. In the game, players play with a given number of dice, and each player guesses by bluffing how many of a given number of dice are in play, and then it is essentially up to luck whether his guess is correct. This is relatively easy to do with a small number of dice, as there are a finite number of possible moves, but with a larger number of dice it is more time-consuming to calculate the possibilities. The AI Spy A Lie web game aims to investigate how different agents compete in a game of Liar’s Dice. These agents are based on reinforcement learning. The Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network and State-action-reward-state-action agents choose different moves dur- ing the rounds, so that sometimes the agent wins, sometimes the human player wins.",

City administrations face numerous challenges on a daily basis that impact the quality of life for residents. Potholes, malfunctioning streetlights, crime, safety concerns, and similar issues are present in the daily lives of residents, and their dissatisfaction is not always expressed in the most appropriate places. Therefore, cities require effective tools for tracking and addressing problems. MuresTracker addresses this problem by providing a platform for residents to report issues and track their status, while also enabling city officials to confront and resolve these problems. The website serves as a valuable tool for improving communication, increasing civic engagement, monitoring and managing problems, and promoting more efficient urban services. It offers a wide range of user-friendly reporting and tracking capabilities and can have a positive impact on residents’ lives and the efficiency of cities. The application allows registered regular users to add and view problems reported by others in the city, including details, location, and who and when they were resolved. Users with administrator roles are responsible for directing problems of a certain category to the appropriate department. Additionally, they have insight into user information and can modify or deactivate users in case of inappropriate behavior.",

It has happened to many of us that we would have liked to go out to play football in the afternoon, after school, university, or work, but it takes a lot of time to ask all your friends if they can and do want to join. Often it is only after a lot of wasted time that it turns out that you end up failing to gather the right number of players, so unfortunately the game is missed. A solution to these problems is provided by the project, which implements a user- friendlyandefficientAndroidapplicationthatallowsustocreateafootballmatchwaiting room after registration, with a specified location and time where and when we want to play. You can add friends to this, search for other players and invite them to join and play with you. If you don’t want to create your own game, you can search for the right one for you and join. Furthermore, the implemented software provides an opportunity to chat with other users, privately or at room level. After the game is over, we can rate the participating players according to different criteria. These ratings help us find the right players for our team. Everyone prefers to play with someone, who has very good ratings and a lot of positive feedback from previous games, even if we don’t know that person, rather than someone with bad ratings. The app also notifies the users of any major events, guaranteeing that it won’t go unnoticed if someone sends you a message, a friend request, wants to join one of our lobbies, or we simply need to rate our teammates after a game is over.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my paper is visualizing the algorithm of dynamic programming through an easily applicable interface. Dynamic programming is an efficient and creative method for problem-solving. Its foundation lies in storing and reusing optimal solutions. It’s a bit like a memory game, where by leveraging previous steps, you can more easily find the solution. This saves time and resources. It is used in optimization, computer graphics, and artificial intelligence. The clear presentation of dynamic programming is extremely important for students. Imagine inviting them on an exciting adventure into the world of problem-solving. Show them how they can break down complex tasks into simpler subproblems, and by solving these, they can eventually reach the complete solution. Enrich the lesson with examples and practical applications, allowing them to see how dynamic programming can assist them in various areas of life, such as data analysis or video game development. By incor- poratinguniqueinteractiveexercisesandcreativeapproaches,youpiquestudents’interest and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This fosters the development of their creativity, logical thinking, and ability to work in teams. The goal of my paper is to present dynamic programming as comprehensively and uniquely as possible, thereby capturing students’ attention and laying the foundation for their future IT skills. I aimed to achieve this through a website, primarily because it is easily accessible and applicable to anyone. Furthermore, it was crucial for the visualization to be carried out through tasks that perfectly reflect the fundamental properties of the algorithm, such as dividing prob- lems into subproblems and memoization. Additionally, I strived to create a user-friendly interface where the visualization speed can also be adjusted.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is the implementation of a unified table reservation system for people and restaurants. As we know, table reservations are most commonly made through phone calls or sending messages, which can be problematic in cases where the phone number is difficult to find or requires extensive internet searching, often unsuccessfully, making the whole process time-consuming. The goal of the developed application is to provide an environment where users can quickly find a preferred restaurant, and make reservations easily, while restaurants can manage these reservations effortlessly. The emphasis is also placed on user reviews, which help in choosing between restaurants more easily. Additionally, we could not overlook restaurants dedicated to organizing larger events. I aimed to offer them a way to facilitate communication with interested parties, thus providing a platform for them to schedule personal meetings with event organizers. Another issue restaurants face is how and where to advertise their upcoming events. Similarly, users may find it challenging to find events they like, as they might not know where to look or might not be informed about them. I wanted to address this by providing an advertising platform within the application. In my thesis, I discuss how the DineEase application was developed and the methods that can transform it into a well-functioning and user-friendly application that meets user preferences. The implemented application uses a modern approach to solve the problem, and I believe it can revolutionize the lives of both restaurants and users by making the process easier for both parties.",

        "abstract": "One of the urging problems of today’s society is the proper reuse of products. The 79 percent of plastic waste is stored in landfills or dumped into oceans, 12 percent is incinerated and only 9 percent is recycled. Inadequate storage and improper, ineffective recycling of products can cause enormous damage. Every year, more than a hundred million marine organisms die as a result of pollution from plastic waste. Selective waste collection can be facilitated by the automatic recognition of envi- ronmental product labels on waste. The recognized symbols together with educational information, can provide sufficient knowledge for users to make the process of selective waste collection more efficient and easier. The current thesis is part of the Greensy project focusing entirely on the problem of automatic recognition of recyclable symbols, which it solves using various machine learning methods, with a corpus designed for this purpose. By creating a data set, it is possible to recognize environmental product labels from a different approach than attempts in the literature so far.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my paper is to examine and to recreate pixel sorting methods within an android application. There are a lot of possibilities to edit and to correct our images, either with difficult image editing programs, or with simple filters, with a click. To get the glitch effect with the pixel sorting method is not one of the easy methods, generally you have to dispose of editorial knowledge and even so it is a time-consuming operation, at present there are few applications, in which it can be applied simply and rapidly. The glitch effect is such an inexhaustible and creative method, in which randomness plays an important role. The best part of pixel sorting is that we can achieve different results from the same method due to the fact that every image is different, so we cannot know what we achieve until we did not try the method to the given image. In addition, it belongs to such an area which is developing in our days, too and can be developed also by ourselves, given that there are a lot of possibilities, and the limits to create these methods are only what you can imagine. On preparing my paper I designed an application, by means of which we caneditourimageseasilyandsimply,bythehelpofdifferentglitchfiltersforpixelsorting. Behind the filters applied on our images, different pixel sorting algorithms make possible within the application to achieve the desired effect. Each filter is sorting the pixels under well-defined conditions and criteria, so that the effect should be as aesthetic as possible. It was a challenge to find such methods which can work quickly also with a higher pixel number, besides, it was important to experiment with those methods which not only sort, but also modify the pixels on the image, so that one can achieve a spectacular, aesthetic and pleasing effect. All these in a creative way by the aid of randomness, all the same with punctually designed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The subject of my thesis is the creation of an application that makes it possible to test web pages with ease using a graphical interface. The objective is to make it easy for the users to test the correct behavior of their websites without them having to learn new testing libraries. The application enables the users to implement end-to-end web tests in just a few minutes. I managed to implement a product that makes the web testing process 90% faster and 70% cheaper than the most used products on the market. The application is built based on a Software-as-a-Service model, so the product is not the graphical interface itself, but the automated testing system behind it. The sole purpose of the GUI(Graphical User Interface) is to create a better user experience and make the application available and usable for a larger audience. The graphical interface is a desktop application, that is implemented using Electron, a technology that embeds a website inside a desktop software, which can be installed and used on Linux, Windows and MacOS. This way we can have a product with a high cross-platform compatibility and the ability to test local websites at the same time. The application is communicating with a server, which is responsible for the project and user data management. This way the users can have the same exact experience from any device they access the application from. The server-side application is written in TypeScript using the Express.js framework inside Node.js. The client-side application was created using Electron, which embeds a Next.js website written in TypeScript into itself. Apart from the above mentioned technologies, both applications use third-party libraries and tools. In my thesis I go into detail about the problems in the IT sector, which I trying to fix with my application. I also talk about the direction that the application needs to be developed towards so it can become an industry standard with time.",

The complexity of these models stems from the fact that not only do individuals within a population differ, but also the external influences on them vary. They can be used for a number of purposes, such as scientific understanding, quantifyingtheimpactofdifferentchangesonasystem,andcanalsohelptomaketactical and strategic decisions. Models can be classified according to different aspects, depending on the number of populations, they can be single or multi-population models, classical or structural. To choose the mathematical method, it is important to determine whether the model is continuous or discrete. The modelling process can be divided into four different stages: construction, study, testing and finally use. Problems can arise when moving from one stage to the next, and it is always necessary to go back to the previous step. In the event of a subsequent change at any stage, the testing phase must be repeated. Mathematical modelling came to the fore in population research between 1900 and 1940, mainly in the context of predator- prey relationships and competition theories. The models still used today are those of A. J. Lotka, V. Volterra, G. F. Gause and A. J. Nicholson. In my thesis, I will use three methods to estimate the unknown parameters of the specified model, including the integral, log integral method, where I will use the Lotka- Volterra predation model as a leading tool for three species, and finally, I will try to improve the results by particle swarm optimization. I compare the results with solutions from an advanced software package incorporating artificial intelligence.",

I introduce the application of the cryptocurrency wallet that I developed called ETHna. Cryptocurrencies are one of the most popular concepts that emerged in the 21st century; the underlying mechanisms of decentralized payments have several advantages. It is important for both investors and lay users to understand the operation of such systems. In my thesis, I will explain how cryptocurrencies are stored, which is far from the traditional way of storing money. During the critical analysis of various cryptocurrency wallets, I shall pay special attention to why this means of payment and the wallets used for their storage need to be approached from different perspectives. I will present the advantages and disadvantages of hardware, software, and paper wallets, as well as the security risks and protection mechanisms associated with them. A significant part of the thesis work will be the presentation of the cryptocurrency wallet application I developed. A contemporary and fashionable design prescribes an easy way of storing cryptocurrencies, and therefore, it is a significant first step for beginners in crypto transactions. During the development of the application, the main criteria were safety considerations, which were combined with ease of use so that users could comprehend their cryptos and manage them easily. When one reads the documentation, one will have a grip on the blockchain, public- key cryptography, cryptocurrency, and its wallets, basic concepts of cryptocurrencies, and the basics of technology. This is necessary for every individual to deal with his cryptocurrencies safely and effectively. Besides, they will understand the structure of the ETHna and will be able to use it.",

However, experience shows that the online shopping trend has continued after the epidemic situa- tion subsided. The focus of my thesis is the online sale and purchase of products, using a mobile application I have developed, which aims to connect the distributor with the customers. This application provides an excellent solution for the online purchase of wall pictures for home decoration purposes, as it satisfies several aspects of the most impor- tant needs of the customers. The app is easy to use, but at the same time it offers the users several options that make it easier for them to select and buy products. After a quick registration, the prospective customers can browse through the products and, if they find a product that they like, they can request additional information as well as add it to their shopping cart. The final list of products from the cart and their price can be viewed and, if everything is all right, users can finalize the order and, after filling in the address, can expect to receive the product that will be delivered to them shortly. Registered users can give feedback on products by rating it or adding a review. This information is visible to everyone, so that customers can help each other in choosing the right product. The web shop admin can upload new products - attaching photos for illustrative purposes -, but even the admin cannot delete or edit the customers’ reviews. This can only be done by the user who added the review to the certain product, thus ensuring that the reviews remain authentic and objective.

It doesn’t have any hidden parts or any elements of chance, everything stands in front of the two players from the very beginning to until the checkmate. In spite of all these, one of the biggest change brought to chess were the programs and algorithms made by computer scientist from the past decades. These offered a deeper insight into the world of chess, calculating the best steps from any given position, from an unfathomable number of choices. As these programs evolved, the game received a whole new dimension of depth, since we could analyze every single detail, the most optimal strategy could be generated in mere seconds. With my thesis, I would like to expand the ranks of these programs, looking to solve chess problems and puzzles, which even thousands of years ago could have occupied people. My algorithms show step-by-step how they find solutions for the given cases, with added explanations. My goal, in addition to chess’ complexity, is to clarify these algo- rithms for anyone, with an interactive interface. My chess algorithms look for solutions to these problems in several ways, in a given example they choose the best steps by analyzing the current situation or they get a solution by testing all the possible cases. By saving the running times, I tried to present the chess problems in easily understandable and visually pleasing way with the help of the most effective methods. Last but not least, popularizing chess, arousing interest in it for others was another goal of mine, since anyone can be an expert of the game of kings, similar programs can help a lot in mastering it.",

As we know, almost everyone in the world around us already needs daily pre-programming of what they need to do in order to get everything done and show up on time at every important meeting. The problem of forward planning is due to the fact that our world is changing at a rapid pace, accelerating, and we need to find a solution to see how successfully we are able to perform our daily pre-planned tasks optimally. We have reached a level where it is important in the life of an average person to examine how effectively they perform their tasks, to what extent they are able to perform them, and whether they succeed in time. There may even be a situation where, in the knowledgeoftwotasksbeingplannedverycloseintimeoneneartheotherandtheperson may not be able to be complete or show up on time, the logical decision to do so is to decide on the basis of importance and priority, which one of the two tasks the person show up for and which task he will perform,finish in time. An appropriate software that can take the priority into account can also help in this case. In this dissertation, I am looking for a solution to the problem of what type of software should be implemented so that a given person can monitor the effectiveness of managing and planing your day-to-day tasks in order to be able to develop himself further in being more productive. I divided the software into two categories and so I will examine: software that already exists and can be used for task planning, and self- implemented software. In order to examine the existing software, I conducted a market research in order to to gather information or find missing functionalities in existing and used software, which I can integrate into my own software. My own solution consists of two software, an android mobile application designed for data collection, tasks registration and tracking will be completed and a web application that is to process the data collected by the android application for the user in order to increase productivity.",

        "abstract": "The aim of my thesis was to create a calorie tracking application. I implemented it using Java Spring Boot and React technologies, with a PostgreSQL database. The application allows users to track their calorie intake and the activities that burn calo- ries, as well as their water intake and sleep duration, as these are also important aspects of a healthy lifestyle and weight loss. My application features a simple and user-friendly interface to facilitate users in logging their daily calorie intake, activities, water consump- tion, and sleep. The application enables users to easily add their meals and beverages by providing the name, quantity, or calorie content. Users also have the option to record their activities, including the name, duration, and calories burned. The application auto- matically calculates the user’s daily maximum calorie intake based on the data provided during registration through a form. In my thesis, I will present the implementation of the design and development stages of the application. I will discuss the usage of Java Spring Boot and React frameworks, as well as the configuration of the PostgreSQL database. The created calorie tracking application can be a useful tool for those who want to lose weight and track their daily calorie intake and activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and achieve their weight loss goals.",

        "abstract": "The development of technology gives opportunity to improve our everyday tool with new, useful features. Security systems are not exception. Computer vision gives a chance to classify objects, persons, body parts or face expressions. Taking advantage of computers, it is possible to build a system that can make deci- sions and notify the user. Using this technology, with my colleague, Marton Szilárd, we have created a security system with artificial intelligence methods which is able to iden- tify persons from pictures of a security camera and decide based on human movement, if an action is violent or not. Doing all of this by using built-in face, emotion, voice and movement recognition. The system has two parts. The first part is a mobile application which notifies the user in case of burglary and violence detection. The application gives the user possibility to customize the system, provides a way to check cameras and notification history. The second part of the system is a server which can process images and make deci- sions based on content of an image, doing all of this by using artificial intelligence. The system can be used as a smart security system as well as for detecting domestic violence.",

In the dissertation, the topic is examined primarily from the point of view of data security. The dissertation will also discuss the types of advertisements, their frequency, the economic role of advertisements in modern web development, the role and necessity of Adblock, and the future of Adblock. The dissertation includes an Adblock prototype Google Chrome add-on written in React (Open Source Front-end JavaScript Library for UI). The prototype is used to illus- trate what is described during the theory and to deepen the specific practical experience related to the topic.",

        "abstract": "Volunteering is an important and noble activity that has a positive impact on both the individual and the community. Nowadays, people have many opportunities to search and browse the web for volunteering activities, but the plethora of information, the many different websites and the long and complicated registration processes can easily discour- age people from doing so. To start the project, I was motivated by the fact that there is currently no platform, especially in our country, that offers a solution to the above mentioned problems. My aim was to design and create a web application interface on client side that would make it easier for individuals, in particular, to search and participate in volunteering activities. The main concern was to enable users to organise or join volunteer groups easily and quickly, without having to contact formal organisations or encounter bureaucratic obsta- cles. In addition, the app provides organisations with the ability to recruit volunteers for their events and coordinate tasks within those events. I used React to implement the web interface of the system, providing a modern and pleasant user experience. Server and database management is handled by my team member, Siko Szabolcs, but it is part of the overall system. For mobile view, we used . NET MAUI, achieving cross-platform functionality with a single code base.",

        "abstract": "The topic of my thesis is to implement an interactive quiz game without restricting the number of participating players using a web application. Quiz games are extremely popular nowadays and offer numerous advantages. People enjoy challenges, especially when presented in a playful form. Live quiz games provide an exciting and interactive experience as they allow players to compete with each other and test their knowledge. The multiplayer mode facilitates all of this. The fact that players participate simultaneously in the quiz game and there is the possibility of real-time tracking of results makes the game even more thrilling and can have a community-building impact. The name of my application is \"SimultanQ,\" which aims to represent this concept. \"Simultan\" refers to shared, simultaneous activities, while the suffix \"Q\" stands for \"Quiz.\" Analyzing existing online and freely accessible similar applications reveals that the number of participants is limited during the game. Within the scope of this project, a web application has been developed without such restrictions. Users can easily register, create quizzes after logging in, and start the game in a straightforward manner. They can enable players to join the quiz by sharing a PIN code, and the players can access the questions based on this information. The application contributes to the realization of beloved challenges, the implemen- tation of engaging games in various topics for different groups, testing knowledge, and the competitive approach can provide a genuine team-building experience.",

NET programming language, which allows users to buy tickets online for movies in different cinemas. Online shopping has been growing in popularity in recent years and has become a common practice in many companies. There are several reasons why it was introduced: Convenience: Online shopping allows customers to access the Internet from home, work or anywhere and easily purchase the products or services they want. They do not need to be in person at traditional stores or make an appointment. Wide selection: In the online space, customers have access to a huge selection of productsand services frommanypartsoftheworld. Theyarenotlimitedto theinventory of local stores and can easily compare prices, brands and quality from the comfort of their own home. Time saving: Online shopping is fast and efficient. Customers don’t have to go through multiple stores or stand in line to pay. They can simply buy and pay for a product or service with a few clicks. Because of these advantages, many companies decide to introduce or expand online shopping to reach and serve a wide range of online shoppers.",
