        "abstract": "This paper describes in detail a system and its architecture for managing direction change and braking signals on scooters and bicycles, using a sensor with an accelerometer and gyroscope on the back of the hand. The project aims to provide a solution for direction signals on the crank without removing the hand from the handlebars, thus avoiding the resulting accidents. The user is able to indicate a change of direction by gestures such as turning the hand sideways, so that it is not necessary to take the hand completely off the steering wheel, thus maintaining the balance of the vehicle. Brake signals are automatic as a result of acceleration sensing. The system uses two microcontrollers (ESP32 and ESP8266), one of which processes the sensor data, while the other runs a web server and lights the corresponding LEDs. The web server is responsible for the communication between the microcontrollers and also runs a web page that acts as a user interface. On the web page, active signals such as turn signals and brake signals are displayed and can be switched on and off. Communication between the different components is wireless using WiFi technology.",

The system mainly performs home automation tasks such as temperature control, watering of plants and automatic movement of shutter, thus facilitating the user's daily life. Nowadays, IoT devices are playing an increasingly important role for people, and we can't imagine our lives without them. Since most people have an internet connection at home, building such an IoT system is easier, cheaper and more efficient because there is no need for wires to communicate between devices. The system I developed and built consists of a central computer with a touch screen display connected to it, where you can follow and intervene in the automation processes, you can see statistics about the temperature in the room, for example. Several sensors are connected to this central part via Bluetooth or MQTT communication protocols, which provide data and perform the automation tasks. In my thesis I document the design and construction of this system in detail, illustrating each part with diagrams.",

In the second half of the paper, I present three models I developed that classified brain tumours into four groups with an accuracy of over 85%. The first model I implemented was a simple convolutional neural network. With the second model I achieved only moderate performance improvements by changing the architecture and preventing overfitting. For both models I tuned the hyperparameters. The best performing model was the third one, implemented with transfer learning and using VGG16 as the base model. This model achieved the best accuracy (96%). In developing the three models, I used methods to continuously improve the performance of neural networks by understanding the different mechanisms of action.

Backgammon and image processing cover two areas of particular interest to me.. The Romanian Backgammon Federation organizes various national and international competitions, where tracking and automatic arbitration are of particular interest. The Python programming language allows for the creation of virtual versions of backgammon, which gives the game a new dimension by interactively playing it on the computer. The goal of game programming was to enable two players to compete against each other on the computer and record the game for later replay. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular library used in image processing. With its help, the computer can recognize shapes and process images, allowing for capturing the sequential playing positions. My goal in the field of image processing, was to extract still frames from a video and identify the position of pieces, thus tracking the game's progress. Therefore, my objective was to create an application by combining Python and OpenCV that automatically evaluates the board game. The software to be made must recognize the positions of pieces and tracks the players' moves, allowing for virtual gameplay between two individuals.",

Today we have the possibility and the technology to measure the physical, chemical and the biological characteristics of the world around us. The goal of my thesis was to build a scalable system for sensors, created with the help of an Arduino, which helps in the integration of new sensors in the system for users, who may face a challenge when integrating a new sensor in an environment with Arduino and microcontrollers. At the beginning I had to create a text-based protocol, written with ASCII code, which provides for the user an interface for dynamic configuration of the sensors and for the collective data forwarding. Several different sensors have been integrated into the sensor system, with which it is possible to measure different physical quantities and monitor changes in values, but also an interface for the collected data. For the better understanding of the real-time data collected by the sensors with the help of the Arduino I have also created a desktop application,, through which the real-time data measured by the sensors connected to the Arduino can be displayed, and it is also possible to save and review the data. The communication between the application and the sensors is realized by serial communication. I designed the application to be used for laboratory purposes.",

Routing protocols play a key role in the selection and routing of data packets to reach their destination through the network. Routing protocols are based on different algorithms, which have different characteristics and operating principles. The aim of this documentation is to create a model to visualise the application of routing protocols, the propagation of packets and the evaluation of data. It also provides a means to compare the performance and efficiency of different routing protocols. Routing protocols are critical to the operation of wireless networks. A thorough understanding of the algorithms and their implementations will allow for a better understanding of the operation of networks, the detection of potential failures, and efficient planning, optimisation and operation. The documentation helps to understand the operation, advantages and limitations of different routing protocols, and helps to simulate networks by providing detailed code for simulations written in the OMNeT++ framework. Three routing protocols are described, a data-centric one (Gossiping), a hierarchical one (LEACH) and a location-based one (GAF), their comparison, conclusions drawn and the performance and efficiency of the routing protocols under study.",

        "abstract": "A significant proportion of biological phenomena can be traced back to genetics, which is based on gene sequences. Decoding these gene sequences represents a substantial challenge in the field of biological sciences. According to a bold estimate, this task could potentially engage the scientific community for the next five hundred years. The aim of my thesis is to implement a simple gene sequence classification algorithm and integrate this algorithm into a software, equipped with a graphical user interface. This may represent a small step toward the solution of decoding gene sequences. This implemented algorithm performs classification based on similarity data from gene sequence pairs within a larger sequence dataset. This methodology allows us to simultaneously process large amount of protein sequences and grouping these sequences based on their similarity. This is made possible by working with sparse matrices which eliminates unnecessary operations, such as addition and multiplication with zero. At the same time, this method has significant memory efficiency, because we only store the none zero values. This method treats the input sequence dataset as a graph. Each protein is assigned a node within the graph, and the initial edges between the nodes are received as input data from the SCOP95 database. These values were created using the BLAST algorithm and they’re form a sparse matrix. This algorithm is a modified form of Markov clustering, in which the two main operations, inflation and expansion, work against each other. Connected subgraphs remaining in the equilibrium state, defining the final result of the clustering. The main parameter of the algorithm is the inflation rate, which determines how much the algorithm separates groups from each other. The graphical user interface provides the opportunity to perform the classification on the 11,944-element SCOP95 dataset or on its subparts, using various settings and can display these resulting protein groups. Furthermore, from any group, we can select two sequences and observe the results of their alignment, which is implemented using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The algorithm could process up to one million protein sequences in a few hours, but unfortunately an appropriate real dataset was not available for this purpose.",

University open days are an annual event aimed at promoting the university among high school students and providing insight into its operation for those interested. This is an extremely important process because an outsider can really only get a deeper look into university life here before deciding to apply. There are several tasks involved in organizing an event, such as managing information related to the event and participants, which are slow and cumbersome to solve with traditional methods, hence the need for a system that makes the whole process more effortless and faster. The aim of my thesis is to create a system that offers solutions to the aforementioned problems, using the advantages of two modern frameworks. My system makes it more accessible to transfer information related to events, save participant related data, and create statistics from the existing dataset for the organizers. The system consists of three parts. I implemented the mobile application using the Flutter framework, which must be installed on users' phones and is platform-independent. Here, depending on their role, users can register, create new events, modify existing events, sign up for events, and generate statistics. In the background, a Spring Boot application runs, which provides access to the data stored in the database and processes and saves the data generated by the mobile application. The third part is the cloud-based storage provided by Firebase, where I store the images, and the MySQL relational database, where I store all other data.",

Among the new possibilities and technological challenges, I aim to find solutions that can help us recognize and treat common cardiovascular diseases more effectively, thereby preventing premature or avoidable deaths. The main goal of my research is to develop new and advanced diagnostic systems specifically focused on the characteristics of cardiovascular diseases. These systems would enable more accurate and efficient diagnoses during the identification and treatment of these diseases. The foundation of my approach is the utilization of electrocardiography (ECG) signals in medicine. These signals provide precise and detailed information about the heart's electrical activity, making it possible to detect various heart diseases or other abnormalities. The first step involves preprocessing the signals, applying filtering and other normalization techniques. Then, I create an RGB color-channel image, a spectrogram. The spectrogram is a visual representation that shows the frequency spectrum of the signal over time. Different shades of color in the channels indicate the intensity of the frequencies, making it easier to analyze the structure and changes of the signal. This process helps extract essential information from the signals and reduces distortions caused by noise. These images serve as the input dataset for my deep learning-based training software, whose main task is to recognize four specific diseases. Therefore, my system will be able to identify patterns or subtle details that are not visible to the human eye, providing more accurate diagnoses for people. This can significantly contribute to improving healthcare outcomes and enhancing the quality of life.",

In today's fast-paced world, events have become so accelerated that it is truly challenging to keep them under control and manage our time effectively. To save time, numerous smart devices and systems have emerged, making people's lives easier. We can even say that we are living in the era of smart systems. My thesis’ topic encompasses such a system. It helps us not only to save time, but also relieves us from a responsibility. This modern and innovative solution allows us to take care of our plants in the best possible way while minimizing the tasks of plant care and maximizing the health and beauty of our flowers. It assists in maintaining the plants in optimal condition, especially when we are not at home or don't have enough time for their care. The system's sensors and controllers monitor the environmental parameters of the plants, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and their watering needs. The smart flowerpot system automatically regulates watering, ensuring that the plants always receive the right amount of water at the right time. We no longer need to worry about overwatering or underwatering, as the system takes precise care of watering our flowers. Through an interactive and user interface, we can easily set the watering schedule, monitor the plants' condition, and track the environmental parameters. Whether we are at home or away, the system allows remote access, enabling us to stay connected with our flowers and intervene when necessary. For the control of the system, I have used an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is an extremely versatile and powerful platform that enables full control and monitoring of my smart flowerpot system.",

        "abstract": "Industrial robots are more and more wide-spread in various manufacturing and logistics processes, where accuracy, speed, and safety are important factors. Robots are capable of automating tasks that are boring, dangerous, or too complex for humans. However, the collaboration between robots and humans represents challenges, especially when robots need to adapt flexibly to changing environments and tasks. The recognition and manipulation of small objects are tasks widely used in industrial and educational contexts. However, determining the type and positioning of these objects is not always straightforward, particularly when they have similar colors or sizes. In this paper, I present a method that enables the Baxter robot to easily differentiate cubes using ArUco markers. I describe how I programmed the Baxter robot to determine the type and position of cubes on a workspace and arrange them accordingly. Throughout my study, I provide a detailed presentation of the system's design, implementation, and testing. In my paper, I have developed a system that can control the Baxter robot to recognize and manipulate cuboid-shaped objects. The system consists of three main components: an image processing module that detects and identifies objects using the OpenCV and cv2.aruco libraries, a communication module that uses the ZMQ protocol to send and receive data, and a robot control module that utilizes the ROS (Robot Operating System) libraries to control the robot's arms and grippers. During the operation of the system, the robot captures an image of the workspace, determines the position and type of objects, and performs sorting based on this information.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, everyone has a smartphone that can solve many problems with various applications. Such useful applications are, for example, applications for paying our bills, but we can also find many applications for managing our day-to-day tasks. Mobile applications not only make our everyday lives easier but can also be helpful in educational institutions. The most commonly used mobile applications in schools and universities are various calculators, translators, and note-taking applications. However, applications for presenting PowerPoint presentations are not widespread among people, so their number is very small and they are not the best maintained or do not have many features that would make the use of these applications meaningful other than that the user does not have to keep a separate device with them. My thesis aims to design a system that allows laser pointers to be used on PowerPoint presentation slides with the help of our smartphone regardless of whether we have an Android or IOS phone. In addition, it should allow switching between slides and drawing on them. The system consists of two components: one part is the server, which receives and processes data sent by our phone; the other part is the phone, which detects the user’s hand movements with the help of the accelerometer in the phone and also sends the pressing of displayed buttons to the server via WiFi. The data required to connect to the server is made possible by scanning the QR code generated by the server.",

        "abstract": "In the modern and rapidly evolving world, there is electric technology behind all our needs, hobbies, and work, which we use comfortably and without problems. In current times, with the increase in inflation, the prices of all necessities have risen, especially electricity. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to our daily energy consumption and do not make changes in our energy usage habits, we can easily encounter financial difficulties. The aim of my thesis is to develop an IoT (Internet of Things) system that enables easy measurement and monitoring of energy consumption of electronic devices within a household. Additionally, the system is capable of monitoring the production of solar panels installed in the household. The data is stored in a database, allowing for future statistical analysis and insights. This provides a more accurate understanding of energy costs and helps optimize consumption while leveraging renewable energy sources. The different units communicate with each other through the MQTT protocol, where publishers (household appliances, solar panels) send sampled data to the broker (Raspberry Pi), where the data is processed, stored in a MongoDB database, and the processed data is sent to a mobile application via a REST API service.",
